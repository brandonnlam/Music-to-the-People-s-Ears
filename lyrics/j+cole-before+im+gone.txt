   I hit the weed I told myself the last time would be my last I don't trust my own n-ggas now my mind racing fast Got my foot up on the gas got a hundred on the dash If the police run up on me I aint stopping for they ass Boy you know my L's dirty if they stop me I'm goin to jail surely I'll be next to my brother in the cell no bail for me Man let me out send me back to bitches that smell Purdy pretty And all I gotta do is call once and she'll be all ready Yeah buddy can't you tell I'm goin thru hell I don't even open my mail I'm in the shower with soap on the towel I need cleansing Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes P-ssy n-ggas running they mouth but we aint flinching The names that need mention I got dreams bigger then your whole team You n-ggas so broke yet somehow you so green I guess this indie started with a penny now I'm getting plenty money Look kid it's raining outside boy F-ck an umbrella n-ggas banging outside boy They guns dumb bell a n-gga Tired of telling n-ggas that's a cease rest in peace We tired of only having just a peace And f-ck policing they killing n-ggas what's the reason His daughter starving and she f-cking freezing So no wonder why he f-cking squeezing They out here bussin' leavin' n-ggas stuck in bleedin' on the flo' Bullets wet you like a semen on a hoe Breathing slow man I inhale One day you tryna make rent next day you in jail Lord knows he meant well So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal Some shit that's darker than the tints up on the windshield Welcome to sinville where n-ggas on base Sh-t is looking like an infield High as a Sprint bill What you think that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills Phoney n-ggas until they are extinct b-tch I've been real One time for the city yea Two times for you Hey And one time for the city hey Two times for you Hey The more n-ggas sayin' Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine All he ever doin' is paintin' pictures of crime Tellin' stories of pain paintin' pictures of dope Bitch if you listen I'm paintin' pictures of hope That boy in class embarrassed because he broke Hopin' the day he won't be the butt of somebody's jokes See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in trailer Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors To middle-class with a backyard and my own room To bein' the only black kid in my homeroom Academically gifted and followed my own rules Was runnin' the streets hey ma I'll be home soon Was out chasin' ho's was out hoopin' Them n-ggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin' So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this sh-t Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch One time for the city yea Two times for you Hey And one time for the city hey And two times for you Hey Girl it's been so long I've been gone from you But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the things I do It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain Girl I promise they gon' know our name Ain't seen you smile in awhile But I been dreamin' 'bout you
