   I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp I live life like the captain of a sinking ship The one thing that I can guarantee I'm like a stepping razor I suggest you stay fair with me Been payin dues for a decade plus Before that I was just another face on the bus Tappin my foot to the beat on the radio Dreamin 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies Oh mom I promise I'm gonna be large Someday I'm gonna stop tryin to borrow your car Gonna go far with charisma and skill Until they put my face on a million dollar bill Atmosphere it's just a ten letter word Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird And if you didn't hear fuck whatevers heard I think you got the sickness I suggest you get it cured Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix I'm gonna hobble down the street 'til I reach knob creek Its not that I don't like you I just don't wanna speak You fuckin freak Now keep your days out my week The world keeps a balance through mathematics Defined by whatever youve added and subtracted I'm pushin on the hammer to trigger the brain Embrace how I live it god loves ugly
