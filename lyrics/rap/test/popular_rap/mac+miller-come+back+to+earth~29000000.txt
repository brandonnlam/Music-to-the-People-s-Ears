    My regrets looked just like text I shouldn't send And I got neighbors they're more like strangers We could be friends I just need a way out of my head I'll do anything for a way out Of my head  In my own way just feel like living Some ultimate reality And I was just drowning but now I'm swimming Do stressful workouts to relief Yeah all the thing I do And spend a little time in her What I won't tell you I prolly never even tell myself And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right When you inside all day I wish it was nice out but it looked like rain Race cars and I'm drifting now I'm leaving forever They told me it only gets better  My regrets looked just like text I shouldn't send And I got neighbor's they more like strangers We could be friends I just need a way out of my head I'll do anything for a way out Of my head
