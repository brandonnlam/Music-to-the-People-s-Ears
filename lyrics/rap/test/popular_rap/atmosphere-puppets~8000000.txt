   I know a guy with the rock star life But he stil don't fly so he's mad at the sky He sits me down he kicks his wisdom He's been around now give him a listen Seems like he's got a lot of complaints About how nowadays things ain't the same Used to place some faith in the basement A toast for this guy And those kids that he came with 'cause they all on the same shit Based on cut down placement Uptown stay strong Don't ever do a dance with the devil now That smile is a sign that you're sellin now Judgment gossip ethics Let's just exploit all this excess Then you feel how he feels To walk around town Lookin' down from them tall heels And who needs fame or fortune When you get the same love That the fame is snortin Future so afraid of yours That you strayed from the course And you came up short Believe he would have more credibility If he wasn't just another drunk pill junkie It's obvious to me that he's still hungry For the superstars a little bad lucky Go ahead and get mad at god Point your fingers at your dad And at santa claus Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage Wouldn't look so bad with the bandage off It goes One for the bar tab two for the shine Let's go to your car do another line Barely trust em their all puppets Love is nothing scared of success One for the bass two for the drums Last call gonna take whatever comes Barely trust 'em there all puppets Love is nothing scared of success I think it's great how you used to great I can't hate on how you choose to relate But I know that you had the potential I understand why you wanted to let go A lot of pressure In the middle of those shoulders And we ain't gettin nothin but older Ain't nothin' changed But the day we run from But nobody knows that Better than you huh
