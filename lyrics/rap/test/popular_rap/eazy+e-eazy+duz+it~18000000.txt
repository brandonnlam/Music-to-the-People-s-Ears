   Well I'm Eazy-E I got bitches galore You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more Wit my super duper group coming out to shoot Eazy-E muthafukas cold knocking the boots 'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster I used to be a mugster If you heard Compton you think I own a drugstore Getting stupid because I know how And if a sucker talks shit I give him a Pow 8 ball sipping the bitches are flipping Slow down I hit a dipping continue my tripping Hitting my switches collect from my bitches The money that I make so I can add to my riches Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat A hardcore villian cold roaming the streets And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats
