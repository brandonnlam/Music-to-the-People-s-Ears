    I'm sparked waiting for the dark to hit Cause once the moon gets above my apartment I catch fits for starting shit I'm smart with it I give it that special touch when I push it Cause I'm also a label rep and I can't allow no bullshit So shush kid shush baby shut your eyes Lay your head back she'd the fear and let the tears crystallize I wish the flies to land upon your forehead When I extract the essence from your head And leave your body resting in Moorehead I've left more dead reputations than HIV can But for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's man I'm watching C-SPAN waiting for the first state rep To take the first step to have me killed off to make this world perfect Well lets get shit right right here right now right away. Atmosphere motherfucker if I need to I could fly away I'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew Serve you with seafood You can't cloud my vision 'cause you're see-through You need to recognize the size of the Atmos You ain't as tall as half this madness past what you practice Obviously you can't fuck with my tactics you bastards That's why you breath fast bitch no need to ask We dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp then peeled it Sent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip Now bite your tongue this is how the mic gets done A whole tree to pick some fruit from man You had to choose the ripest one That said it all it comes from inside and how you ride The sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right Catchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time With lines makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight Your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee So listen please use discretion when you breathe Sound is vibration I choose to use it with a vision And then comes the style and precision... No more longer will we hold your hand Why Cause you're too damn old Oh yeah the networks called They told me to tell you you've been cancelled They also said big up for all the support Thanks to your devotion they now control the world So let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang I'm rising past the bank with smile I'm flashin my fangs I tumble over some 'cause some I don't over stand I got the clout from Spawn from now on I know the plan It's the noise it makes that generates the passion I have It's the void it breaks that stimulates when mics get grabbed It takes shape escapes from these vocal chords I have Atmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab Come now whofi gwan test the giants when we apply this Vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print The tyrants that gave you crisis left you silenced Don't breathe a sigh of relief 'till you hear the rescue sirens Supreme be this team we got this shit on lock Obviously we hid the key under an upscale rock So you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in You could try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in Nigga what my definition is raw I got you all Wishin' I'd fall so things could get better for y'all But I'm tall and got game remain the same for the duration Area code 6-1-2 my present location... Atmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not abuse it Blessed with insight friends and influences That's what keeps us dope what makes us dope is the surroundings Inspiration stems from love and stress compounding Stamina: that is achieved over the course of time In fact time taught me how to breath battle not to court my mind Defined as lyricist the Atmosphericist Makin sure you fear this shit every time you hear this shit Sound is vibration  This sound is taken Sound is vibration  And the ground is shakin' Vibration is sound  Yo we found your replacement Vibration is sound  Now who makes the sound : And who makes the music/sound fades out
