   feat. Whild Peach In the eye of the storm Looking out through the rain Gabriel blow your horn They shield me from tsunamis and the hurricane Hear a thunderous voice Shouting there will be no peace Until our people rejoice When every boy and girl is freed You see it's going down The wars and the mysteries But my friends ther'll be better days And a better way According to the prophecy It would be so nice To hook up in paradise By all means we must go Or are you in the low Like all the way up so child You been a friend of mine
