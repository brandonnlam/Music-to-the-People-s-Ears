   V1 24 The premises get vacated?The millisecond I kill the seven niggas that play jaded/ Within a record I chill the tepid temperatures they've created/ With their pitiful minimal efforts to make statements I spit on em got em schillin out money to cover their late payments/ Cause they're way dated these dumb motherfuckers have never paid dues and believing that they've MADE it/ For as long as Im repping intelligent lyrics I figure I'll stay hated But my mindframe is to Remain Patient/ With niggas posing about as hard as a stippers nipples on stage naked/ Yo I can't take it I'm keeping em plummeting toward the bottom like stocks that's daytraded/ Net-fiasco's Get these asshole's Fates Tainted/ Got em flaming &amp relocating like Gay Vagrants/ Tonedeff's slays giants as if my legal name's David/ What I say's Blatant no apologies necessary to glaze the game blazing/ Touch overdubs or change the phrasing/ Lyrically maintaining/ my jugular vein's straining/ Tonedeff adds to the pressure with bass so deep it makes your brains cave in. I'll break it down for the laymen for the niggas that ain't acing basic training/ My rations got their trays swaying/ Galleries use my verses for Page framing/ Cause hey I stay flagrant with lyrics nastier than Tammy Faye bathing/ Keep comp shook like charter plane when it's raining/ I stay phat on the underground like there was a buffet in the main bassment/ Sometimes I be slaying for entertainment/ Im outclassing motherfuckers without even having to weigh in. V2 24 No one's as gifted or as vigorously meticulous with a writtern scripture/ Or spits with this infinite syllablism that I've been equipped with/ Should I quit with the quick shit or pitch shift a negative 50% in an effort to get rich/ Or stick with the swiftness for the niggas that get this/ Even when I'm simplistic I can be unbelievably cryptic/ The rhythm endures the physical force to split a tree with a discuss/ With the ease of a flicked wrist your soul can be seized from a distance/ In an instant by this Plague affiliate that's seething with sickness/ I seem to get listless with these kids when I see what they dismiss/ Cause anything missing a punchline'll get eased outta business/ Like delivery's not important Rhythm and rhyme schemes are ignored it's horrid/ Son if you can't flow then become a comedian a ghost writer or poet/ If you ain't repping the artform then don't record it/ Heads are starving and fiending for an assortment of global proportions/ If you ain't feeding the scores of supporters then you're hoarding/ And you're a whore that's killing your heritage like Lizzie Borden/ The dexterity I display scrambles your cells like you was a dizzy warden/ Committed to scoring more than a jiggy mormon/ With a diamond studded bible that bling-blings in the sunlight/ When I rhyme at full throttle I'm titled Supreme Being when I come tight/ And these things are finally done right/ Like obscene scenes riding your slut wife/ Our extreme flings stifle your love life/ Stun like blunt strikes from a swung pipe someone was hiding from sight/ And exceed speeds of fire in gunfights. V3 16 And you can bank on it The playing odds'll stay solid/ If you remain brolic with name calling leave with a ganked wallet/ I take solace in making profits like fake scholars/ That want you to waste dollars for paid knowledge in state college/ With great prowess I face off with and shank cowards/ And waste all their debased followers Break laws with a brave heart like the late Wallace/ I chase robbers escaped convicts who rape songs and create garbage/ Embrace carnage they ain't artists Sample their flavor and you'll taste vomit  I need a reminder to intake oxygen/ Space-Polymer Based oxidants.. Say hot shit display confidence/ Hey audience  Just wave arms till it's plain obvious/ Play God and persuade crowds to behave honest and pay homage/ And pray thoughtlessly awful authors are marked for death like stained coffins/ I keep clean cause I bathe often and never illegally trade documents/ Hate-mongers repent Let me set it straight I'm the heavyweight like long lines in front of a Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers Potna. Chorus The Heavyweight flow It's tonedeffinite Everything goes/ Can you Play NO With Your Petty Stage Show It's Tonedeffinite Ready Wait GO The Heavyweight Pro with the heavyweight flow
