I do this for my culture no image to protect Just broken down lives and broken objects Disgusted with how far that my greedy eyes stretch Preoccupied with fame 'cause I'm tryin' to be the next No famous relative to help me with my master plan Just family members that came overseas from other lands Shit I'll fake a smile before I walk around depressed Plus I want success I'm not accepting nothing less They say a man is judged by the way that he provides I don't wanna have to die for people to realize Followin' a trend to me is I'll advised 'Cause the world will judge you regardless of how you feel inside Niggas say they fly but they ain't touch the sky They ain't even off the ground they just talkin' from their pride It's easy to reside in the valley where we walk But it's harder to think before you even get to talk These damn gucci niggas got no love for us hoopty niggas And all the wild groupie ladies wanna mooch our figures Scorcese couldn't make a better movie picture Like Mumia Abu Jamal I capture all my listeners Freedom is relative I'm feeling like a prisoner Every day I'm sicker 'cause I got dropped by signa Now it's beneficial cards and mediocre service And I'm startin' to go nuts the media's a circus They say here's where all the meteors are headed I love startin' drama I'm learning how to dead it I love doin' work and giving God all the credit I live life wisely so I don't regret it I'm a supernova so my aura's so magnetic And every time I spit a verse it get's eclectic Gotta show these skeptics they could never critic And if they wanna get it they could get it
