Catch me holdin' on the OE conversate with Zoe Only gonna remember her T-shirt with David Bowie Its so clear the hipsters here and the queens are there and the rest are near It's the FAM crew and were back at it again This time in a house of a friend of a friends Only 11 PM now with your eyes and your ears listen up to how the story begins The beat brought the energy I brought the soul Hope I don't get drowned in liquor and end up runnin home Got my homies to keep me composed now that's real And that girl Zoe over there knows the deal I don't wanna cuff to confine me Every move you make choose your way I'm with it Gettin' loose with crew right beside me Let me approach what I scoped out I'm with it Any minute now we can exit the spot And take what we got home and get acquainted Lift your brow got me spillin' out vows From your style to your smile love you got me chasin' Lets go C'mon time to break up the best smoke Carter can I hit it Don't make me kiss ya and beg for it This house so big it needs exploring So come along girl were diving in head first I said yeah baby yeah make that granite counter top yours One more minute and we'll bring it to the bottom floor Applaud for the encore and I ain't even on tour The thunderstorm is coming I wonder who will conquer That's simple it's me got the freshest expressions and essence up on my tee They all askin' how'd I end up like Jay Gatsby The set up of the place was pretty hot With a smoking section dance floor and a porch to cool off Barely know her but I know that she's rarer than moon rocks With Cartie in this bitch the party don't stop ha I don't wanna cuff to confine me Every move you make choose your way I'm with it Gettin' loose with crew right beside me Let me approach what I scoped out I'm with it Any minute now we can exit the spot And take what we got home and get acquainted Lift your brow got me spillin' out vows From your style to your smile love you got me chasin'
