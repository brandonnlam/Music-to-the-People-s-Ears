     You were all there was when I caught up so you drive away She caught my love I can smell you from a mile away I feel your touch when I wake and when I go to sleep I lost your trust is there really much that I can say Yelling at the world telling it to slow down I'm parked outside your house Just thinking ’bout the thousand times we made up on the mountainside Don't give up on me now Talk or walk when we rolling around  You know I'm new in town girl Don’t know where I'm at but I need you around You move to the sound so twe hit up and down Fuck They laugh I'm not no Clout God unless I go to Hollywood and I go uptown You're a diamond in the rough people look what I found ooh I love those moves to kill it with the juice mix it all with the music Play with fire up in the sky I'm up every night we need compromise You had other guys but they weren't wise to leave you tonight Tonight When I lie in my bed you be by my side tonight When I'm fly in my head I get butterflies She said Real lies real lies all your little lies Well let me say how I feel inside  You were all there was when I caught up so you drive away She caught my love I can smell you from a mile away I feel your touch when I wake and when I go to sleep I lost your trust is there really much that I can say Yelling at the world telling it to slow down I'm parked outside your house Just thinking ’bout the thousand times we made up on the mountainside Don’t give up on me now Talk or walk when were rolling around
