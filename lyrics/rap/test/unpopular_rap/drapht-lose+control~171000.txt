   I lose control Represent my soul and my heart Held for a start Against the whole word in the dark Fell from the ark I'm noahs third animal Never making the cut fed to the canibals Man I'm pulling my head out Start making a change I'm a fool but I've set out to represent your name Maa Came up from no fame and fortune Just to live life and hold my head high When i walk through the crowd of these doubting eyes Walked every day Every night Never found the light Just mounting ties with these hood rats and snakes All the people you call crims I call my mates I break laws to live Never take more than needed Skateboarders' them graphers leaving the walls bleedin' Yeah we're reading Yeah we're just as cultured as men holding holsters And upper class vultures A pulse is the only difference with you While you drive a rolse royce I hold the vision of truth While you hold the cash I hold the bloody passion of a knife That will fight for his king And his country And his life I lose control I lose control Of everything of everything I've ever known I've ever known I lose control I lose control I lose control I lose control Of everything of everything I've ever known I've ever known I lose control I lose control Driven to the bottle God has gotta save me I'm lost in the matix You must turns to maybe He's forgotten maybe betrayed me Left me rotten Maybe be thankful for life that he gave me Remember Yeah that lazy day in september Blessed with a good heart But cursed with a temper Yeah 10 percent of your bloods from a emperor The fam you decend from defend no surrender And when ya Lose it its your fault Your bad Cant catapult all the blame back on your dad Mad cause the way that he raised you Made you The man you are today Now one made those mistakes too Its the break through Finally see you making tracks Make one wrong move bruz See you taken back to square one Where one will never recognize That you switched your position until you go and check the dice And the second time over isn't easier No one will believe in you And all your friends are leaving you And growing up Moving on Know enough when you were wrong People might remember to call you and ask you how your goin' And no one gives that theres no existing love for you Maybe you'll believe in yourself And you'll start loving too Knowing this is the key to the treasure chest The last place you look that you'll never guess I cant ever stress enough now man I pick up blocks of gold Turn em to sand Everything i seem to touch Seem to turn to stone I sware I lead the pack Look back I'm alone Cant control myself Hold myself together Losing faith in the game Even tho I'm better than the competition Its so undefined I need to listen and the only problem is that I lose control
