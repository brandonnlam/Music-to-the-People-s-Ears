   I feel like a zombie slumber's beyond me Nights getting longer long as luke longley Smallest sound is like a kombi van back firing Was a comedy camera hired up in on this nightmare Nah I wish it was a nightmare Then a least I'd be asleep in my bed My eyes bright red feel like death by bed Weighed down cause my heads like lead Like ned kelly belly up nothing stops me getting up From weed paraphernalia or taking valium I tried it Every herbal remedy diet from reading to writing Nothing makes me tired My mind racing sleep deprivation The only one awake playing the waiting game I'm facing the sun in an hour Everyone seems to be sound asleep Insomnia I can't eat feeling the heat can't sleep Insomnia It's just me and the sounds of police on the street Insomnia I can't eat feeling the heat can't sleep Insomnia No retreat cause I never thought it'd happen to me Feel like I'm in a parallel paranoid paradise Every word on repeat like a parrots life Every beat in my head starts to paralyze Fahrenheit rising feeding the parasites Like a satellite analyze the world cause I'm up again Antagonize by every gust of wind Must have been a comatose in my last life Now I lie awake like puffin on a glass pipe Can't hide and tryna count sheep Count three thousand and thirty three man please I need my z's I'm tossing and turnin Determined to kill tyler durban and beat the Insomnia insomnia Strands of light on the bedroom floor Strands of light on the bedroom floor I'm locked on nocturnal Can't watch the clock or stop the time turning Nothing that the doctor concocts is working Only the warlock can drop the curse on this earthling The worst thing I work in three hours Can only scream like a werewolf howling Hope I'm powered by moonlight soon might My crew are like sucks to be you right Too right yeah sucks to me friend It's monotony like trying to find the seas end Deep breathing I plead for a little sleep I pass fatigue now I questioning my beliefs I can't believe it Can't remember the last eight hours sleep I had All this anxiety is bad my brain won't stop Find ya losing track of the days when you got Insomnia I can't eat feeling the heat can't sleep Insomnia It's just me and the sounds of police on the street Insomnia I can't eat feeling the heat can't sleep Insomnia No retreat cause I never thought it'd happen to me me
