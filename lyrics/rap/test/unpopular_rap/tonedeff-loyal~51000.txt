   Have you ever been betrayed That shit's the worst hit of pain/ When somebody you loved can't look you in the face/ And have you ever had your heart torn out by somebody you thought was a friend/ And now your trust is worn down or bought to an end/ No pardons can mend it when you're darkened within/ Fuck your cause &amp effect it's a hard fate to take and your reasons don't soften the sin/ Your dogs can bark for you but you gotta watch when you argue/ 'Cause dogs will bite and snarl at you just to remind you they're harmful/ I feel awful I'm a mental case shattered to pieces and I've got a palm full/ Past law school and beyond consol/ 'Cause you've crossed the bar with me farther than I've ever thought possible/ My choice is now mandatory and not optional/ Don't speak another sentence to me ever mention me/ I don't exist convince yourself you invented me/ You've committed the crime of the century/ And just cause loyalty ain't a trait you possess Don't think that I'll lessen the penalty. What's your name again I know I knew it 2 seconds ago/ But I don't recognize this 2nd face though to the 1st it's identical/ You were the type that I put on a pedestal. Your acts were commendable/ But the bond of friendship isn't impenetrable/ And inevitably the blunt force of ego proved lethal/ To a good person forced to wallow in the shit of evil people/ Fundamentally filled with avarice a cheat from the soul/ Spending their lives to make sure that you ain't achieving your goals/ Unreasonable kings that want to see you jump through rings of fire For their own amusement holding nooses hoping trees are higher/ So abusive towards you that truce just doesn't seem required/ 'Cause why play the game When you can make the other team retire/ Strings are tirelessly pulled in your favor as you play the rumor creator Twisting words till they sound like statements you made up/ With a big grin you soak it all in as former friends/ Go face to face with contradicting convictions/ Plots are thickening cause you pitched in. You feel important now?/ Must've been high as kite from snorting clouds/ Sorta proud of yourself and the way you hold ya ground/ Distastefully wore the shroud how's it feel to have puppets to order 'round/ But I saw through you even before I found How you would say 'no beef' give me dap and hit me with a quarter-pound/ Your loyalty's watered down Bottled with a squirt cap/ But When the drama popped off where the fuck were you to plug the cork back. Men are as harsh as women are vindictive/ Picking apart minutiae On some bitch shit kids all in your business/ Forget honesty nowadays you'll be lucky find that quality/ In a drama oddessy where cats never react responsibly/ And I'm jostling with haters hypocrites and hypochondriacs/ Abolishing their dated ignorance and fighting copycats/ And If I don't give my patience a rest/ I'll prolly take my anger to death complaining about some pain in my chest/ Aged and distressed thinking 'bout who just fucked me over 20 years ago/ Amazing how pricks can miss your skin yet pierce your soul/ But where's the line at Like where does loyalty appear to fold/ And what do you OWE someone and just WHAT do you feel your owed/ But yo you know when you've been done wrong that numb calm A breech in the moral code's eternally portable/ The moral of the story's old even if it's poorly told/ Beware of cats that straddle fences like the chain-link rodeo.  I love you in a place where there's no space in time And that's forever right I love you for my life you are a friend of mine Only second to family I love you in a place where there's no space in time Who really got your back I love you for my life you are a friend of mine How loyal are your friends y'all
