   Can I dance Ooh ooh ooh Awww shit Big Boi Big boi What if everything you ever knew or known was lost The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts You pause for the cause try to recall and remember But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center Cause your mind ain't free constricting by the motherfuckin' boundaries An ounce of weed or an pound of dro Couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting life from bro Brother brohem Cadillac on bows strike a pose then the door slams wham nigga wham don't they say that in they show damn For show man actin like a tadpole out of gonads you now how catch the truth hit the booth we makin more jams Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program fuck the learning curve We took our ramp to no man's land Hello is anybody home is anybody givin dome Serve me up I want some When I'm left alone I get to thinking to myself The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use it until none's left Like everything is alright clearly tight to death I can see clearly now analyzing every step Clearly you can feel me 'cause it's beating through your chest And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip wet wet With no tint not yet clearly I'm a vet And not a vetinarian but clearly pitbulls are the best Like the O-you-T-K-S cleary nigga you know the rest And if you acting like you don't cleary nigga you trying to test Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway 'cause the ticket is a one-way clearly back we won't be coming
