    Spinning in circles live my life without rehearsal If I die today my nigga was it business Was it personal Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful You made me versatile well-rounded like cursive Now you chose me for purpose I put my soul in these verses Born sinner was never born to be perfect Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers Teachers treated niggers as if they totally worthless And violent and hopeless I saw but never noticed that the college is right to be Or that you can be bosses Rest in peace to Tiffany I don't know if this is the realest shit I ever wrote But know that the realest nigga wrote this And signed it and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you would find it And knew one day that you would come back and rewind this singing... I'm a born sinner But I got better tonight swear Yeah this music shit is a gift But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff I got a life in my grip she holding tight to my wrist She screaming: Don't let me slip She see the tears in my eyes I see the fear on her lips True when I told you: You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane My roof in the pouring rain You knew me before the fame don't lose me the more I change you Just grow with me go broke you go broke with me I smoke you gon' smoke with me Woman's curse since birth man lead her to the hearse I go Bobby you go with me damn Listen here I'll tell you my biggest fears You the only one who knows them Don't you ever go expose them This life is harder than you'll probably ever know Emotions I hardly ever show More for you than for me Don't you worry yourself I gotta do this for me They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways Ducking calls from my mother for days Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say Except
