   Yo man... There's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' But scared to kick reality. Yo Dre you've been doing all this dope producing. You had a chance to show 'em what time it is... So what you want me to do Express Yourself... I'm expressin' with my full capabilities And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities Cause some don't agree with how I do this. I get straight meditate like a Buddhist I'm droppin' flava my behaviour is hereditary But my technique is very necessary. Blame it on Ice Cube... Because he says it gets funky When you got a subject and a predicate. Add it on a dope beat And that'll make you think. Some suckaz just tickle me pink To my stomach. 'Cause they don't flow like this one. You know what I won't hesitate to this one Or two before I'm through. So don't try to sing this Some drop science Well I'm droppin' English. Even if Yella Makes it a-capella I still express yo I don't smoke weed or assess Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage And brain damage on the mic don't manage Nuthin' But makin' a sucker and you equal. Don't be another sequel... Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it... Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it... Ice Cube is not for the pop chart So where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself My boy'll show you how Yo Dre What Up Drop English Right about Now gettin' back to the pg. That's program and it's easy. Dre is back. Newjacks I mean hollow Expressin' ain't their subject Because they like to follow The words the style the trend The records I spin. Again and again and again Yo you on the other end. Watch a brother playin' dope rhymes with no help. There's no fessin' and guessin' While I'm expressin' myself. It's crazy to see people be What society wants them to be. But not me Ruthless... Is the way to go They know. Others say rhymes that fail To be original. Or they kill where the hip-hop starts Forget about the ghetto And rap for the pop charts. Some musicians curse at home But scared to use profanity When up on the microphone. Yeah they want reality. But you won't hear none. They rather exaggerate a little fiction. Some say no to drugs and take a stand But after the show they go lookin' for the dopeman. Or they ban my group from the radio. Hear nwa and say Hell no!". But you know it ain't all about wealth. As long as you make a note to... Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it... Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it... A lyricist Yo Dre is the name for that makes somethin' dope on a record That's what he came for Kickin reality understand himself but it's important that you keep it in mind to... Express Yourself... From the heart. Cause if you wanna start to move up the chart Then expression is a big part of it. You ain't efficient when you flow You ain't swift movin' like a tortoise. Full of rigor mortis. There's a little bit more to show I got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo. Or a lesson all of 'em expression And if you start fessin' I got a Smith and Wesson For you. I might ignore your record Because it has no bottom. I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn It's Dre on the mic gettin' physical. Doin' the job Nwa is the lynch mob It's so macabre But you know you need this. And the knowledge is growin' Just like a fetus or a tumor. But here's the rumor: Dre is in the neighborhood And he's up to no good. When I start expressin' myself Yella slam it Cause If I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage. Or I'mma be too hyped And need a straight jacket. I got knowledge and other suckers lack it. So when you see Dre a dj on the mic Ask what it's like. It's like we gettin' hyped tonight. Cause if I strike It ain't for your good health. But I won't strike if you just... Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it... Express Yourself... Express Yourself... Come on and do it... Express Yourself... Come on and do it... Come on and do it... Come on and do it... Come on and do it...
