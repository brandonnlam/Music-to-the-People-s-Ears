    Yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah yeah Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind Because it's lurkin' Who really has the time  It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I know so fine But really I'm buggin buggin makin' something out of nothing  Yeah as harder it gets the karma collect it Holdin' my wrath this ain't what I expected Don't argue to death pull my heart out of my chest The cards are all on the table I'm callin' it Don't say it I swallow it When livin' off the borrowed time Often I'm on the fence on a line Addin' up what's on my mind My feet on the clouds head on the ground That we goin' down bet you know me now  No threat in water I swear If I drown I don't care They callin' for me from the shore I need more  Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind Because it's lurkin' is it is it is it is it is it Who really has the time  is it is it is it is it is it It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I know so fine But really I'm buggin buggin makin' something out of nothing  It feel like the weekend on the Tuesday I can move days Its I got something else to do day Always do hate If I do say The do say with the homies like it's Kool Aid Me I'm just tryna play it cool J Yeah mind over matter I'm Purer than alkaline Bitch stuck on album time I gotta get out to shine  I was buggin Miss me like you gettin' withdrawl I keep that coming yeah  I'm threat in water I know If I start movin' I flow They nothing- Just play it cool baby just play it cool You know cool  Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind Because it's lurkin' is it is it is it is it is it Who really has the time  is it is it is it is it is it It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I know so fine But really I'm buggin buggin makin' something out of nothing  Yeah tell me you love me spend me around Pretty please pick me up in the air and don't pull me down You seen it all I fall you sat back and watch Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks untill they stop Bare feet runnin' late her car is started Even though the only thing that she driving a hard bargain More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but Just put me back together when I'm out of order Perfect
