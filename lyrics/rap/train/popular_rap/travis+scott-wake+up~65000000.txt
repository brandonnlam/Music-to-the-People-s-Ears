   feat. The Weeknd  I don't wanna wake up I want you spread out on the sheets Said her pussy so good And her pussy so sweet I don't wanna wake up I want it flowing through my streams Getting me hot Under my feet I don't wanna wake up  Please don't wake me up I feel it creeping yeah Controlling how you moving lucid dreaming dreams Always on the side of different seasons yeah yeah Took the belt-way down to your hood Say you was in the crowd I never looked Looking back how things came back around Guess I was hooked Burn the bread and then we burn the town We both was cooked yeah Nah nah please don't wake me up feel like I'm dreamin' Any given Sunday you can get it Willie Beamon I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend That’s coco out my ice tea coco yeah yeah Bend her over for some piping it's lit Bust a cloud shoot the lightning pop it Pop it now no we can't sleep  I don't wanna wake up yeah Want you spread out on the sheets it's lit Say pussy so good pop it Oh pussy so sweet yeah When I wake up yeah yeah Wanna drop top on the beach straight up Getting me high yeah yeah Under my feet When I wake up  You decide if I live or die When you're close I'm alive I can feel the sky I just want your body close to me oh And if I OD I'll be alone with no heartbeat I hold the hills with a coast in the Lambo And the doors going up suicide  I don't wanna wake up I don't wanna wake up I want you spread out on the sheets want you spread out on the sheets 'Cause that pussy so good pussy so good Girl that pussy so sweet pussy so sweet I don't wanna wake up I don't wanna wake up I want it flowing through my streams want it flowing through my streams Getting me hot getting me hot Under my feet under my feet I don't wanna wake up
