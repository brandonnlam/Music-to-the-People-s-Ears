NEEDS HELP Run it Run it  Late night or early morning I can't tell They praying on my downfall I wake up fly as hell Can't shoot me down forty thousand feet above L.A I put it all into motion to take over been underway Ooh I know they want a piece of me If I put it on a record it's a guarantee from me What you need from me I been on me from the junk Got a girl with the back You can see it from the front All over the map She ain't seen me in some months Hate when I hit the road Love when I do the home runs If you never offline then you on one I let my boys talk Hardly ever do my own stunts I ain't really with the actin I'm with the action I let a lot go Addition by subtraction If I don't know you don't remind me And if you're s'posed to you'll know where to find me  Low-key squaddin Choes keep watchin Love it when they do it to the boy need options Whole team mobbin Whole team mobbin When I come around got the whole thing wobbin Wob-wob wobbin Wob-wob wobbin When I come around got the whole thing wobbin Wob-wob wobbin Wob-wob wobbin Let me know you down And I hit it up  Tell me who you love Tell me who you love All my homegirls think I'm getting groupie love All the roadie chicks looking for the movie love They think I'm famous I don't even got a tour bus You in lust Talking like it's just the two of us Holding up the line You like "What that got to do with us?" Nada but holla if you wanna I'm onto these girls They act like Madonna I gotta get in and get out Disappear like kada Hop out the whip Like "wadda" with my bruddas Do it like I said I would inch-by-inch I been stackin up exes like pitch-by-pitch Live life pinch-by-pinch Not s'posed to be here Told some old girls that I would they said Be real! Nash jumping I ain't even had my leap year yet Speck the true We the premiere set We been  Low-key squaddin Choes keep watchin Love it when they do it to the boy need options Whole team mobbin Whole team mobbin When I come around got the whole thing wobbin Wob-wob wobbin Wob-wob wobbin When I come around got the whole thing wobbin Wob-wob wobbin Wob-wob wobbin Let me know you down And I hit it up  Tell me who you love Tell me who you love Tell me who you love I been on my drank and smokin Lovin girls and leave 'em hopin I been on my drank and smokin I was hopin you were comin Ride with the boy get lost for a lil' bit Rode through the old spot for the shit of it You been givin off signs for a minute huh I didn't read 'em right huh I'm illiterate I been all caught up Try to balance in the world Where they all want some Girl they all want some Girl they all want something Where did the time go I remember when this shit would move slow round here Where is everybody that I know round here I'm a stranger now where do I go round here I think I'm livin two lives Sometimes I think I'm livin two lies I think I think too much After I drank too much Imma drop you off here Girl you mean too much
