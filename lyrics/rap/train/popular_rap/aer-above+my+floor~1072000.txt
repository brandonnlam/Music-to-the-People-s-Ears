I never wanna know ya I think I see him walking Collide with the ghost above my floor High headed up the corner I think I see him walking Say hi to the ghost I won't become  He and I could fight all night But he is me so get this right I'm torn inside but act so bright And who to be I can't decide So I'll roll the rest up rid the pressure Diesel from forty on top the dresser Inhale the smoke I'll clean the mess up Opaque hope extreme measures Indulge in all types of pleasures Don't talk to him I can explain it much better Imma medicate myself if I want to Not a level head and will say anything bout you Looking in the mirror finding someone to shout to The answer's in the haze so I'll figure it out soon I'm keeping up 'cause I'm fast learner Tryna disregard my evil as the worlds turnin' The ego in each of us wants to eat through the furnace And then heat up your house and just laugh it off as it's burning I never wanna know ya I think I see him walking Collide with the ghost above my floor High headed up the corner I think I see him walking Say hi to the ghost I won't become I've learned to pick quality over quantity When does confident become cocky What if I told you that's not me Hiding behind expensive liquor and Kawasakis The diamond's getting bigger I'm in the rough of the Rockies Power trippin tricked into giving the guy who brought me What he deserves been on my nerves Despite it all I can find the courage I'm high in attic so close to the angels But he's in the basement playing games with the devil I'm tryna get out and see the world from all angles He only wants to stay in and polish up all his medals Spun out in the city makes it hard to say I'm stable Ain't giving up for nothing no homie I won't settle Crumbs crushed up on the old wooden table High above the problems is me having my head up
