    Ren is the villain and you're just an hostage So whenever I'm steppin cover your head like an ostrich Groupies been waitin for this suckers been hatin for this You know why Because so many are relatin to this Jealous is how they feel it intentionally But they start to love it becoz I made it eventually Pumpin the music I keep the music like pumpin Coz Ren ain't in here for nuthin I keep the average crowd jumpin Yo you know the color the villain's in black Always down to make noise and attack So you better get back unless you wanna come with it And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it You're screamin with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin You're wakin up in a sweat coz Ren is givin bad dreams and I'm not schemin I'm just tellin the facts That's how it is when N. W. A. Starts to jack So brothers that wanna scrap with me That sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me Especially beggin to write some lyrics with me I just snatch your girl to take a nap with me Coz when it comes to Ren there's no comparison And if you try to be me it's quite embarassin But I understand coz you're mentally slow Coz I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go If it aint' ruff it ain't me scratch If it ain't ruff it ain't me scratch Lemme bust a freestyle here  I can tell that you're afraid to fight me Simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me Becoz you're sweat as a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat I'm a threath so get a cold rag and wipe your neck And clean the dirt off your face that calls acne It's ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me This is the round where the punch will go Until ya A G-A-T that's known as a flow I'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin Like see I'm hatin the fakin I keep the suckers like shakin Scared to speak with a tongue and they're chozen The sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen This is a battle to the death it's like the  Against a brother on a tip with  Givin a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin But I'm comparin and tearin'em but I'm makin a livin With the hype of a 9 Volt battery And the odds for me to conquer is averagely good Meanin I'm a flow I'm from the streets so yo I'm ready to go If it ain't ruff it ain't me  If it ain't ruff it ain't me  The 'do not disturb' sign is in effect While I'm thinkin of a fool to select To give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim Slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them Tell'em they're guilty and beep out the bailer And get a new track o' drums so I can play with Percussion pumpin it loud when I perform Yo you wanna play in my game put on a uniform It ain't a rule in the book you have to go by Hey coz when it comes to cheatin yo you should know I For fear in the hearts coz it's the hearts full of fear Coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear The hump was incredible yo but Ren he was super But now I'm ruthless a civilian and not a trooper But a soldier with a top rankin Givin dope material the hell with the gankin So play like an airplane and just jet And keep your blood pressure low coz I'm a  If it ain't ruff it ain't me  If it ain't...
