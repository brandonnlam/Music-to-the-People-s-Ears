   I grew up a f*ckin' screw up Tie my shoe up wish they was newer Damn need somethin' newer In love with the baddest girl in the city I wish I knew her I wish I weren't so shy I wish I was a bit more fly I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside That I'm the perfect n*gga for her but then maybe that's a lie She like a certain type of n*gga and it's clear I'm not that guy Ball player star player I'm just watchin' from the side On the bench cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly I ain't grow up with my father I ain't grow up
