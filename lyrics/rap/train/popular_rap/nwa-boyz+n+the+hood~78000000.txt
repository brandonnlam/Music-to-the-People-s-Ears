Woke up quick at about noon Just thought that I had to be in compton soon I gotta get drunk before the day begin Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends About to go and damn near went blind Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs Ran in the house and grabbed my clip With the mac-10 on the side of my hip Bailed outside and pointed my weapon Just as I thought the fools kept steppin' Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride I got front 'nback and side to side Then I let the alpine play Bumpinnew shit by nwa It was "gangsta gangsta" at the top of the list Then I played my own shit it went somethin' like this: Cruisin' down the street in my 6 4 Jockin' the bitches slappin' the ho's Went to the park to get the scoop Knuckle-heads out there cold shootin' some hoops A car pulls up who can it be A fresh el camino rollinkilo g He rolls down his window and he started to say It's all about makin' that gta Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit' Don't quote me boy cuz I ain't said shit... Dolla b'z in the place to give me the pace He said my man jb is on freebase The boy jb was a friend of mine 'till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal a alpine Chased him up the street to call a truce The silly mothafucka pull out a deuce-deuce Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gage One sucker dead L. A. Times front page Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit' Don't quote me boy cuz I ain't said shit... Bored as hell and I wanna get ill So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill The fellows out there makin' that dollar I pulled up in my 6 4 impala They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin' And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin' Love to get my girl to rock that body Before I left I hit the bacardi Went to her house to get her out of the pad Dumb ho said something that made me mad She said somethin' that I couldn't believe So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave She started talkin' shit wouldn't you know Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho' Her father jumped out and he started to shout So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit' Don't quote me boy cuz I ain't said shit... I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control Then wrapped the 6 4 'round the telephone poll I looked at my car and I said oh brother I throw it in the gutter and go buy another Walkin' home and I see the g ride Now kat is drivin' kilo on the side As they busted a you they got pulled over An undercover cop in a dark green nova Kat got beat for resistin' arrest He socked the pig in his head for rippin' his guess Now g is caught for doin' the crime For the fence on the boy he'll do some time Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit' Don't quote me boy cuz I ain't said shit... I went to get the mouth but there was no bail The fellows start to riot in the county jail Two days later in municipal court Kilo g on trial cold cut a fart Disruption of a court said the judge On a six years sentence my man didn't budge Bailiff came over to turn him in Kilo g looked up and gave a grin He yelled out "fire!" then came suzi The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her Both up state for attempted murder Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit' Don't quote me boy cuz I ain't said shit...
