   I stormed off the set Lit a cigarette Headed straight for my trailer I sent Celeste to get coffee I only drink the best And then she went and slammed the door to her tailer Her her slayin’ blamin’ her agent sayin’ “One more minute working under these conditions And there’s going to be a death.” What a bitch She’s sayin’ leading lady was a hack Not one of them can act Everyone’s a jackass And they’re running around backwards So what do you call that I’m the only reason they bankrolled the film Have you seen my receipts I’m a big deal A big deal for real Pelling her face back Revealing the savage A dragon disguised as an actress Feeding off the drama You want drama I’m your man Drama I’m your man Had a few breakdowns Feeling kind of bad Til they paid me a half a mil Just to talk about rehab A little complicated Yes I’m medicated Heavily medicated Insane in the brain from being famous And then she walks around saying They want to get in her jeans I put out a lot See see what I mean It’s like All the guys want to be me Okay All the girls want to do me VIPs wish they knew me So go ahead and sue me Oh fucking hell I’ve got a top lawyer and an ego made of armour I’ll see you in court It’ll make great drama You want drama I’m your man I met a holy man A metaphysics teacher He was deeper than Choprah Biger than Oprah As I was feeling generous I gave him some advice I said “No-one ever got a thing by trying to be nice.” Really I said “What about karma?” I said “Huh?” Well I said “What about karma?” I said “Huh?” I said “What about-“ I said “I heard you the first time.” shit I said “What about karma dharma Dalai Lama Hare Rama Obama or Gandhi…” What do you mean It’s just drama You want drama I’m your man Drama I’m your man
