   This is my first confession my father its So hard spilling my heart like gaza strip So far I'm scarred like its part of my skin Its carved in by anger my cardanal sin My heart large as a lion The stingers barb had to hit steve now I believe I'm dyin I need your guidance need the light thats whiter The the silas needing your vibrance To silence the violent voices the poison Avoid the poison the paranoid choices destroying The gift of life that you gave me Maybe a kiss goodnight from your lady the meaning of life Then why would you make a world when you scream help they hide Know why cause life's a xxxxx but you still here gotta thank god for it But I'm falling what else can I say I'm fadin away I'm fading away I'm fading away I'm falling what else can I say I'm fadin away I'm fading away I'm fading away Its been two years since the last time we spoke I broke the codes of the cannon law you wrote The stone carved commandments Feels outlandish live by the laws or vanish Banished to pandoras box If I'm real sorry and branish a cross am I lost For my life time yeah you watch as a witness Done some real dumb drunk xxxx need your forgiveness A sickness its self inflicted my world revolved around girls An egyptian curse an addiction swimming in sex Ma said show women the respect they deserve Six six six isn't fiction either listen or your existace will burn Or the tables will turn on you Those ladies are humans too you abused that And I knew did it for amusement Now its on my back like a baboon grooming Assuming your losing your patience If I regain your grace will I have a place in ur kingdom Or am I facing extinction the day where the human race starts sinking Is near pardon my heart almighty Just another part of society I'm sorry Yeah I lied and I stole from thy neighbour Fornicated way yeah I played up I haven't made a Sunday mass since twelve Will I ever leave this world Yeah I lied and I stole from thy neighbour Fornicated way yeah I played up My behavior is blasphemy Will it all come back to me we'll just to wait n see But I'm falling what else can I say I'm fadin away I'm fading away I'm fading away I'm falling what else can I say I'm fadin away I'm fading away I'm fading away
