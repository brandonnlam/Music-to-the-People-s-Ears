   If you and I were meant to be You wouldn't test my sanity Corrective lenses in my brain Twist my thoughts so I can see It's all about who's wrong or right To see who's words have got more bite 1,000 ways to kill the light Frustration taking over Too many pictures all at once Too many shadows in the rain And I see a crack up in the sun Calling out your name It's everything Everything you wanted But if what we had got lost along the way It's everything Everything you needed And I'm reaching out For all the things we lost along the way Should I turn and walk away When other paths may lie ahead Too many feelings in my heart Try to search for what you said I try to be in tune with you I try to symbolize your dreams You wouldn't let me take you there Frustration taking over Too many pictures all at once Too many shadows in the rain And I see a crack up in the sun Calling out your name It's everything Everything you wanted But if what we had got lost along the way It's everything Everything you needed And I'm reaching out For all the things we lost along the way Too many pictures all at once Too many shadows in the rain And I see a crack up in the sun Someone calling out your name  I can't believe in everything I can't foresee where I begin And there's nothing left to understand And so I just give in  It's everything Everything you wanted But it's what we had Got lost along the way  It's everything Everything you needed And I'm reaching out  For all the things we lost along the way  It?s everything  Everything you wanted But it's what we had Got lost along the way  It's everything Everything you needed And I'm reaching out  For all the things we lost along the way
