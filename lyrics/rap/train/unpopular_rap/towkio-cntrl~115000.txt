   Don't you wait too long 'Fore you end up where you don't belong If you stay it's your fault and it's yours come on Minds get blown those dots connect lines get drawn But something draws me to you even more And that something draws me to you Something draws me to you That something's got a hold on me Takin' me higher is this ecstasy I see 'cause ooh you drive me crazy Ooh you drive me maybe the wheel to take control of me Minds get lost dots connect lines get drawn But something draws me to you even more And that something draws me to you Something draws me to you That something's got a hold on me I said take control don't take too long that sky might fall We all go through our phases habits won't fade these things evolve So take that medication That's only temporary aid you need your salvation And up your doses when it's less effective Take a flag I'll bleach it then raise it I'll be your prisoner take me I'll surrender my faith When I'm surrounded you take me captive We can't escape attraction yeah it's the chain reaction make me your slave Minds get lost dots connect lines get drawn But something draws me to you even more And that something draws me to you Something draws me to you That something's got a hold on me Takin' me higher is this ecstasy I see 'cause ooh you drive me crazy Ooh you drive me maybe the wheel to take control of me Take control of me Take control of me take Take control of me me me Take control of me See I can call again call it that something is drawin' me closer Yeah I'm drownin' my head above water there ain't no warnin' I will follow that light at the end of the tunnel I want it If it glows out I'm cool with the darkness Do anything for it I promise I need it your beauty is beamin' I'm trapped in your glory I can't ignore it This feeling I'm feelin' I'm an infant I'm reachin' At this point I'm dependin' pray I'm goin' the distance But I know something's got a hold on me Takin' me higher is this ecstasy I see 'cause ooh it drive me crazy Ooh you drive me maybe The wheel to take control of me Something's got a hold on me Takin' me higher is this ecstasy I see that ooh it drive me crazy Ooh you drive me maybe The wheel to take control of me
