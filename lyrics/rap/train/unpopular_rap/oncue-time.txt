You keep runnin' round town Like there’s nothing else to lose So tell me what you found Time don’t wait for you Said time don't wait for you I said time time don't wait for you We haven't talked in a while Shit I know it I been too damn wild I hate to show it At a loss for words ironic 'cause I'm a poet And these kids think I'm a hero But nothing 'bout me heroic Shit it all fucked up when I went and lost my Lois Funny that when life's a bitch that's when she make you take notice 1 year in 4 songs done I'm 'bout to blow this Telling just the album coming but fuck that was my moment Reminding myself like why'd the fuck you move out here Didn't you have some big ass point to prove out here Let me refresh you and someone just like you Someone walking in your shoes Was never born to lose nah This rap shit been your heart since you were 9 boy So stop being a pussy shit get on your grind boy I promise one day that you are gonna be a great But keep up with these mistakes A bitter man is in your grave It's hard to watch your peers rap up on the TV Screen You stuck at home refreshing G-mail for some fucking beats Waiting on a check to come so you can get some food to eat Reading all your mentions and your fans think this shit so sweet It's even harder when you know that you could kill 'em all Few wrong turns got 'em smiling 'cause they see you fall I ain't mad I ain't salty I'm just giving you all me I’m just giving you all me You keep runnin' 'round town Like there’s nothing else to lose So tell me what you found Time don’t wait for you Said time don't wait for you I said time time don't wait for you Quit blaming Ceej and Jay 'Cause goddamn man this shits a fucking game Someone told me that a King don’t place blame But there's blood on all our hands So I’m just pointing at the stains And CJ bro you know that I love you dog Want you to know this world is yours But only if you want it all Another life for real we were supposed to ball Seems like yesterday when we got the call I’m sorry if you’re mad that I wrote this It's been bottled inside and I needed a prognosis Haven't been talking to God but writing this was the closest And I heard the toughest battles to his strongest soldiers so It wasn't all their faults For real I hit a deep depression City tried to killed me instead it taught me a lesson If you want something you go get it your fucking self And trust me you’re your own Devil of your own fucking Hell and I'm sorry I wanted to make something timeless I'm sorry I don't put bullshit on your timeline I'm hoping that they care enough just to rewind this So they can at least further understand my mind And if I die tomorrow at least that I was honest Ever since I woke up underneath the skyline Don't cry baby just please pay homage Listen to your heart and motherfuck the guidelines You keep runnin' 'round town Like there’s nothing else to lose So tell me what you found Time don’t wait for you You keep runnin' 'round town Like there’s nothing else to lose So tell me what you found Time don’t wait for you You keep runnin' 'round town Like there’s nothing else to lose So tell me what you found Time don’t wait for you Said time don't wait for you I said time time don't wait for you
