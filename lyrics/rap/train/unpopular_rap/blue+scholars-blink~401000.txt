With war rising over the horizon It's hard to start writing Been fightin in the belly of the titan my tourniquets Tighten around the livin' but dyin' My pen floods the pages while the children are crying I want to put on an iron shirt chase the devil out of Earth Spit until my tongue and saliva glands burst But first I invoke the spirit of the long gone and Coming back through the song I am one with that all-seein' being but It seems as if we're being tricked into believing that Which we think we believe in Even if we disagree on who the best mc is We bob to the beat as if we're nodding in agreement I write to freedom though freedom hasn't come I let it ring to leave a message on my answering Machine I see a movement has begun As soon as we become the true truth seekers Down with this Babylon regime To think you can die in the blink of an eye I bid you to try to test I &amp I  Been destined to fly But I'm restin tonight And one bright morning I will take flight But until then I'll be rockin on the m I see the future drippin out of a pen If sleep be the cousin of death Then every time I blink's one step closer to my last Breath It's said talk is cheap but war is expensive I speak cuz it's free and these words are my weapons Don't think for a second I will not question us foreign Policy imperial aggression inventing war for he Quenching of the thirst for the oil Cuz money don't trickle down to workers who toil you See Blood trickle down from the wounds of the soil And broken antennas with aluminum foil Standing on televisions transmitting propaganda of Millionaire senators And your so-called commander in chief b I'm telling You the man is a thief In his head he holds a plan to ban your freedom of Speech To build a pipeline put Afghanistan on a leash When it bites back blame the Taliban for the breach Of security in each and every first world country Where life more dissin' If you're thirsty or hungry To think you can die in the blink of an eye I bid you to try to test I &amp I  Been destined to fly But I'm restin tonight And one bright morning I will take flight But until then I'll be rockin on the m I see the future drippin out of a pen If sleep be the cousin of death Then every time I blink's one step closer to my last Breath America romanticizes the old war story Heroes ammos guns blood guts and glory And no wonder the majority wants a war with Iraq Even if only 15% know where it's at on a map With our backs against a stockpile of weaponry Enough to turn the earth into a memory 'cept there'll Be No one to remember this planet If it happens god damn it if I get drafted today I swear to God Ja Allah and Yahweh I'll toss the letter away and I'll pull a Cassius Clay In the military Minorities comprise the majority Surprised Are you Kidding me The lies rely on brown bodies to fight for white puppet Masters I cannot fathom how the caged bird drinks Until he thinks he is free A critical mass between the heavenly future and a hell Of a past now To think you can die in the blink of an eye I bid you to try to test I &amp I  Been destined to fly But I'm restin tonight And one bright morning I will take flight But until then I'll be rockin on the m I see the future drippin out of a pen If sleep be the cousin of death Then every time I blink's one step closer to my last Breath
