   Lust once ya feel it in your bones yo you know you can't stop it/ Understand Let me expand while we're on the topic/ I date plane Janes hot chicks/ But I usually only fuck with female pilots cause they got the illest cockpits Ha and if the crotch fits where it/ I'm the type of Martha Fokker to ditch a bitch the day before I meet the parents/ She's embarrassed she's dating a rapper with baggy pants/ Pick her up from mass system on blast grabbing her ass/ Glad we could smash but I gotta move on to the next chick/ I'm an outgoing male I send one off and I get one back like Netflix/ Now get this when you're sexually reckless you can have a girl that makes you breakfast/ But you'll still seek the rejection of a leggy temptress/ She's like your petty deathwish/ You be dressed in your best shit tryna silence the skeptics/ Upset kids called her a |hoe and I hoped to god it was true/ 'Cause see a hoe fuck everybody A bitch fuck everybody but you/ I'd forget about it but soon I behold it's a sign Envisioned a coked-out Whitney signing Moment In Time when I told her I rhymed/ And fames the best aphrodisiac know to man cause now we holding hands/ Saying 'lets blow this stand' and yo I hate to spoil plans/ So now that we rolling I'm the Trojan man she's stroking it fast/ I'm jonesing for ass but I almost choked on the gas when I opened her pants/ So potent a blast a fish that It was scary man/ I snatched the pine tree from the rearview mirror and sandwiched it in her hairy clam. I got pussy pussy pussy on my mind and it's killing me/ 2 to 3 at a time menagetwois or a trilogy/ I really feel the need to sing this song/ 'Cause I dated a bi-chick for 3 years and I never got my threesome on/ There's only so many tricks that one woman can teach a schlong/ And even Cheech &amp Chong agree more than one freak sure beats the bong/ But I've reached the wall and yo I've only failed Knowing that getting the most available hoes with tail to bone &amp bail's the holy grail/ Now for the solo male there isn't the fattest chance in hell/ You can ask two bad frat chicks to nail without landing your ass in jail/ And that's the real haphazard deal when one set of tits ain't enough/ Ya' want wetter clits save the hunt Son you better just pay to fuck/ The way my luck is on whether I'll get or get got/ Is slim but if the chance comes I can't front I'll give it a shot/ And I'm shitting you not the day came when I was put to the test/ Because of my stage name I met these three hookers looking for sex/ They claimed Janessa Brooke &amp Beth were their governments/ And wanted to triple the pleasure and triple the fun like they were doublemint/ I'm stuttering I'm looking down at my dick 2 chicks is rubbing it/ Beth tells me to look at her tongue and then imagine my cum on it/ Then suddenly one of 'em starts crying some shit bout her ex-man/ And when one chicks in need the two others WILL ditch the sex plans/ With staff in hand I'm asking Is it the time for this shit?'/ From the back of the pack I hear 'Can't you keep your mind off your dick  This is just another sad song For times like this when everything's mad wrong You missed your chance you gotta keep your pants on When things don't go your way. Go your way. It's another assless night When the shorty your with isn't acting right You're forced to fuck chicks who aren't half as tight When things don't go your way. Go your way.
