    I wonder when it will stop Promise I get so high Have you ever seen God Have you ever seen God Wonder when it will stop I take another pill until I feel hot I up the dose my tolerance on Woodstock I wonder when it will stop The cops yeah they kill kids Then act unfamiliar Then cover up the case like it's makeup concealer Damn why that hate so built up The truth is in your face no filter If we didn't have this hip hop How would we all get by Would we just move them Ziplocs Our only get rich plot 'Fore all of them try to get mine Until the day I flatline My tía play that lottery I pray she win that jackpot I wonder when it will stop Someone call Dr. Philip Tell 'em all those prescription bottles need to get filled up Turning them into zombies in the street no Thriller Suppression ain't the cure something that they ain't consider  I wonder when it will stop Wonder when it will stop Wonder if it will stop I don't think it will stop World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop  I wonder when it will stop One day I got so high To the point I seen God Fill my eyes with tear drops I'm sitting on a gold mine I learnt about the re-rock We boom until it's all gone and then we go and restock I wonder if it will stop They tell us that that door's locked So we gon' kick it down hit them stains like Chlorox We out here and we on that So picture it like Kodak But no election shorties out here asking where that pole at They need that for protection We pay for education So who are you in debt with That money if you make it You probably have to hold back So really you ain't make shit So tell me what's the problem if we ever find time I said I'm worth a whole life so I guess I made a killing And if I made enough then I could pass on to my children She tell me who's the villain Then why you got them chains on Same reason that I'm here tryna write the same song  I wonder when it will stop Wonder when it will stop Wonder if it will stop I don't think it will stop World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop  For that I let these tears drop Swear it's been a long time Let me let these tears dry Now I'mma make this song cry Lay it all on the line Had to watch some friends pass Man that shit fuck me up Turn me into Mad Max And I got some homies out here tweaking off that Xanax Amongst other products we import sweat a jab like a grab bag Damn that shit fucking with my conscience But that's the price you pay when just tryna see that profit I said wonder when it will stop I swear that I'm a good guy But to my girl I still lie Until we say our goodbyes So tell me who's the victim Don't tell me 'bout statistics They turn us to some numbers then just add them to the system And don't tell me that we stuck here Don't tell me it's just physics Don't tell me 'bout them problems Just find a way to fix it We doomed from the beginning I know that makes us all scared Really at this point I know that we do not belong here  I wonder when it will stop Wonder when it will stop Wonder if it will stop I don't think it will stop World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop
