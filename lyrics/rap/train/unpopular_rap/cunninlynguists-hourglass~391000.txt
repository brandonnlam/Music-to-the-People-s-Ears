   I don't have you And like true friends And say I'm sorry you're blue I don't have you And like true friends They still come around I'm waiting for growth to show up and for hope to manifest 3 A.M. I'm awaiting awake to hand me rest Fate to send caress and a face that I can feel With weight from heavy breasts An embrace that helps me chill Grace that human males can't feel Unless he builds with a female until time stands still When we take off our shells and chill All before fingers learn bodies like we got blindman skill She speaks no evil but says whatever After shaking up bed-feathers still prays together On a parlay flip permenant private party trip The next Ruby and Ossie Davis I'm talking great shit Up walking late lit. 4:25 high Her mighty fine thighs silhoutted by sky-rise Place the know how behind my eyes To take something unfortunate And show them they're a fortune in my life Look KY side lend me a hand send me a plan A Remy Shand message of love tell Cupid we fam' And to clock something that'll learn who I am As I learn with chillin out watching our hourglass sands I don't have you And like true friends And say I'm sorry you're blue I don't have you And like true friends And say I'm sorry you're blue Spent Pubescent years blessed with peers I could trust Spinning records to a game of checkers after dusk Laughter rushes out of mouth clutchin my stomach abs burning From fast learning not cash earning Cause we wasn't really on 'at yet just yes' y'alling At this point our lil' brainchild was hardly crawling But had fallen enough times to keep a niggas head strong Fucked with enough spiders to charm a mama leglong We's dead wrong many days and nights Trying strange thangs From jane to cane and variants of the same change Get trapped you off map no Peter Pan scenes Where everythings tight and lily whiter than Klan dreams Tryna get something ripe a nice woman queen Stay strong and fight life like Sudan kings Pray to make cents for giving And make sense out of living Lord give me patience to gain wisdom please
