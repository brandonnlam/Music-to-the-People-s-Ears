   I channel I am a channel I am a channel So channel me Not alone you are not alone Not alone I said we are not alone Not alone I said we are not alone Not alone we are not alone No no said we are not alone We not alone we are not alone No no no we are not alone We are not alone You are not alone It's all a dream To the Earth we're bound So to sky we pray This is all we know Guess we never stay We are warriors 'Til we not alone God willing make it to the top but it's no ceilings I seen a man kill a man body lose feeling You can run up I don't care who's with 'em I get the gold plaque you can get the blue ribbon Big hand hit him while he dance make him lose rhythm Okay Mama told me nothing but the people wasn't drived as me Guess I didn't learn kiss the shit make it pop artery I pull up in the car to a Carter III I'm rhymin' thuggin' like it's '08 in the Bay mind in the ghost state I should get a standing ovat' You should back up 'cause this shit hot You don't want that eye contact I can tell you lying on back Say it like you mean it bill big as Keenan tell 'em running I need all that Catch 'em on sight go to work merger 'cause it's off-white Get 'em all fast turn that soft work into hard cash Tony Montana Tony Montana I swear they leave me no choice But to get that silencer so that bitch do not make no noise Bullets on mute-mute-mute hit you like pew-pew-pew But ain't got shit to lose so bitch you best not move I swear it's fate Real life real talk this is my life Everything past this point just in the twilight I travel light-years to get lost in that dark mayyer The type of mission you don't come back from I swear this that far sight That's a new vision I chase the light that's where they find me if I ever go missing I'm in that Earth Wind &amp Fire and I'm all in my element chemical imbalance Started off drug peddling drug peddling I hit some stains got some things stolen But I guess that's karma 'cause I did the same to someone And that this is all full circle laws energetic And with these cause and effects I swear it's all connected man I swear it's infinite From the stars down to our genetics In this pool full of nothingness Feel me in the new dimension In this world that is so synthetic I'm just trying to find some truth in it We are not alone Swear it's all a dream To the Earth we're bound So to sky we pray This is all we know Guess we here to stay And we're warriors So we not alone
