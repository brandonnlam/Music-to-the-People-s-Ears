   Through the eyes of wonder I see creation unfurl The beginnin' and endin' of my mind twistin' in curls so I'm out of the box of thought enterin' a new religion no man can ever hold me down breakin' through a system And I wanna believe no tricks are up your sleeves but yet as you turned around a card fell down and it was an ace of hearts so you just lost face so I'm never gonna listen to anything that you say okay So now I'm movin' on to the next song cuz ya just don't know whatcha got until it's gone cuz if you did you should treasure it like a kid the knife of life is sharp when you're doin' a bid. Hello playin' the cello Nah I got percussion my heart beat heavy and bass give you concussion my soul grown deep like rivers now ain't that somethin' Don't come too close mind under construction. Buildin...  Buildin...  Buildin...  Buildin...  Buildin...
