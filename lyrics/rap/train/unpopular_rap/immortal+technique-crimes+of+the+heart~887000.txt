    I turned 21 in prison locked up at night Now I walk around free it seems like another life Another role with some other dice Another hole or a loving wife People come and go Some really you never know Intellectual midgets that really never grow Fake love that hangs on like can I hold you though With no friends that look at you like yo yeah I told you so A toast to the broken hearted who never finished what they fucking started People who go out and try to be a rebel at night Who try to make up for the fact that they settled in life It's like a fight between the devil and Christ over the limelight Spiritual celebrity poker but the whole deck is full of jokers And every year that you get older the stakes get higher Gambling with a bunch of fakes and liars Real talk cos the real New York is the pain and the suffering of lost love Staring off into the distance of the mist in the club Depression and emptiness that lead to suicide And the struggle inside yourself that keeps you alive Surviving medicated stalked by sobriety The life you live now tortured by memories violently I pray inside of me that one day you can be forgiven For murdering the beautiful world in we used to live in  Crimes of the heart  Love doesn't need a complicated metaphor And sometimes nothing even needs to be said at all Sometimes the person you with is not your one and only And you just fuck with them 'cause you afraid to be lonely And when you come back it's too late So you overcompensate like victims of rape for the self hate Lost in the affection of strangers around you Instead of the only person who ever gave a fuck about you Thought you were happy so you didn't come check me But then when he cheated or treated you incorrectly You conveniently realized that you could never forget me And tried to crawl back in my life unexpectedly These are my indictments of those who claim to be righteous And leave a trail of broken hearts on they way to enlightenment But I can't give in to hatred and pass judgment Even towards every illusion I've been in love with Cause the heart that betrays itself willingly Is like a nation that trades freedom for stability It's so seductive to be cold and corrupted And isolated trying to be an independent republic But liberty to be loved on the surface is worthless The sacrifice of revolution with no purpose Take it from a criminal searching for his redemption Cursing the god desperately trying to get his attention  Crimes of the heart  Round we go more cause Climbing through the endless night Looking for the shining light Who's it gonna be  Who walked inline with me tonight  Endless night
