   One two three four I am sad and I am lonely My heart it will break My sweetheart loves another Lord I wish I was dead My cheeks were once red As the bloom on a rose But now they're as white  As the lily that grows Young ladies take a warning Take a warning from me Don't waste your affections  On a young man so free  He'll hug you he'll kiss you  He'll tell you more lies Than the crossed eyes on the railroad Or the stars in the sky I'm troubled I' m troubled I'm troubled in mind If trouble don't kill me  I'll live a long time
