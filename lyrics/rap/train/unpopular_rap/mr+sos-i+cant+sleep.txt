   How can you sleep in these troubled times I don't Know How can you sleep in these troubled times Ey yo fuck it. I guess I can't so I stand Up on my feet and try to relax drinking cans Of That's like drinking can- Cer in a container but fuck it. What isn't You're already dying if your living And I'm sinning but I'm asking no one for forgiveness Because the people running the church is a crooked Politician So I'm tripping but not psychedelic more like Psychotic Because I'm sick of these psycho bitches in my pockets What are my options other than to just sit and just Watch it Have them take action and try to stop this nonsense Crying alert And trying to feed never thought I'd wake up to see The mark of the beast but I did now how can I sleep I can't even dream without even To help with keep up with the concscience And by that I mean awake Cause now I'm feeling that sleeping was my biggest Mistake But I don't know How can you sleep in these troubled times I wanna Sleep but I don't wanna let my guard down How can you sleep in these troubled times I can't Sleep my gears are grinding too hard now How can you sleep in these troubled times I never Sleep more than four hours at a time now How can you sleep in these troubled times I don't Even wanna lie down because if I do then lights out Super insomniac rolling up comiac Blunts in a Pontiac Like pardon me honey but where is your mommy at Fighting for innocence. Trying to be militant Even though at times I'm high and belligerent Lighting a cigarette not with tobacco in it But don't start acting strange and stuff These ingredients ain't as dangerous as angel dust I promise you I've never been violent or psychotic Dude But at times I just might forget who I was talking to But that's the worst of it. At least I know what my Purpose is I never swerve it If it was legalized I would Purchase it Or perhaps that's the deprivation and later when I Awaken I can meditate over my statements but fuck it You need to know this. Every song recorded Should reflect a moment in the life of the person that Wrote it As well as the personality of those that support it And if you disagree may the cousin of death leave you Slaughtered Because you're sleeping How can you sleep in these troubled times I wanna Sleep but I don't wanna let my guard down How can you sleep in these troubled times I can't Sleep my gears are grinding too hard now How can you sleep in these troubled times I never Sleep more than four hours at a time now How can you sleep in these troubled times I don't Even wanna lie down because if I do then lights out Who can you turn to when you're in a rut and uh Who can you turn to when you're fucked up and uh Who can you turn to when you're feeling stuck and ya Who can you turn to feel like everything sucks. Tell Me Who can you turn to when you're feeling stressed and Uh Who can you turn to when you're in a mess and ya keep Hearing Peace and love are the only keys to gladness Yeah that's what they say to me So I go day to day trying to live patiently Pacing myself. Staying as safe as can be Walking with broken two wings Adapting while time keeps changing degrees rapidly You can tell by cracks in the streets Because it's aging but see But amazingly not one agency Has concerns for saving things Except for maybe me and my people Who stay with me fighting courageously Haters who sleep major but can't take it from me Because I never sleep
