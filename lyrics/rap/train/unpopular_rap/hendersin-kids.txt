I could say it but you won't believe me You say you do but you don't deceive me It's hard to know they're out there It's hard to know that you still care I could say it but you won't believe me You say you do but you don't deceive me Dead hearts are everywhere Dead hearts are everywhere  Shows being booked Songs getting quoted Lot on my plate 'yeah I got my basses loaded Busting on the scene yeah It's like I exploded The same ones that used to hate me The same ones that promoted tell me Flashback Freshmen Said I don't wanna play Bridgewater cool I'm sorry I don' wanna stay Because I got another dream I needa' follow Inside screaming No its never hollow tell me Wallow never that Life I might said I bet they said What are you doing because rap ain't what you better at I said Fuck your hoop dream. Sorry but you seem I'm happy like me maybe you should switch the tell routine me Said I need to find a new way yeah I gotta keep going yeah I might have went off-track but tell them I'll be back back  Tell me everything that happened tell me everything you saw They had light inside their eyes they had lights inside their eyes Did you see the closing window did you hear the slamming door They moved forward and my heart died they moved forward and my heart died Please please tell me what they look like did they seem afraid of you They were kids that I once knew they were kids that I once knew  Three years later instead of working on my free throw I'm working stages making about a G a Show I'm doing good it's understood But even so this industry is crazy man I swear y'all even tell know me Because your oldest friends they become your new haters Only the strong survive yeah I thought you knew nature And these tour dates just bring more fakes Putting up a wall guess I needa get more tell gates me Cause I forget the man nah I don't let him in They talk about the show wondering if I can get them in Aye what you said again doomed it from the start Cause I put it on my heart like a letter of a letter man And so I just share a song keepin' it up like a marathon Girl got a short dress but you know her hair is long Yeah we rage cause we do it out of anger Familiar faces couldn't look stranger  Did you touch them did you hold them did they follow you to the town They make me feel I'm falling down They make me feel I'm falling down Was there one you saw too clearly did they seem too real to you They were kids that I once knew they were kids that I once knew  I could say it but you won't believe me You say you do but you don't deceive me It's hard to know they're out there It's hard to know that you still care I could say it but you won't believe me You say you do but you don't deceive me Dead hearts are everywhere Dead hearts are everywhere
