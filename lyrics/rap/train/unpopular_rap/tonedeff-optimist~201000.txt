   Chorus: Life is wonderful. Life goes full circle. Life is wondeful. Verse: 1 Sometimes I hate everyone and everything To the world itself Even though I'm the portrait of health And been blessed with many things Cause when it seems life's beginning to take A splendid lead Suddenly everything tends to lean negatively I used to feel my luck was bled from me at seventeen Because ever since positive outcomes have been Seldom seen They tell me that bouts with doubt can self-fulfill Prophetically And that's prolly why John &amp Paul said that It's best to let it be And I use to be the cat with plenty kinetic energy Happy go lucky Mr. Follow-Your-Dream-And-Set-It-Free But over the years son I've been jaded to the Nth degree I hate it cause my sense of grief Is blatant and my friends agree See people's selfish deeds lead to my Bleak expectancy Like If I catch the E I never expect to see an empty seat (Nice But in typical fashion this'll pass Until my next defeat Until I'm stressing deep and forced to beg and plea Till then we'll sing. Chorus: Life is wonderful. Life goes full circle. Life is wondeful. Verse: 2 They say I'm a natural born pessamist And that's fuckin wild Must've come with my mother's smile And father's bullheadedness I pull ahead and get pulled back But I keep struggling Son I feel like I couldn't catch a break beat juggling Still I reach upward and on And proceed trudging along As I lead these brothers in arms To achieve what's in our hearts But the scene's shrugging us off So... I just remember that every dream comes with a scar When I see something I want When it seems nothing is wrong well I gotta keep telling myself to stop Waiting for the other foot to drop Live in the moment sit on the throne And just take a look from the top It's a whole other perspective to see The good that you got Now if it's an omen quit with the moaning Don't let it push you to flop That's like being spooked at the doc since You was a baby still shook from the shot Don't imagine a tragic end to the book When there's not You gotta try to rewrite inspite of how crooked the plot. Chorus: Life is wonderful. Life goes full circle. Life is wondeful. Verse: 3 Now when you go this long uphill You lose the will to climb it So I wrote this song to remind me of the silver lining In a world this wrong gotta carry A sword that's strong And slice 'em all with smiles Y'all -- I fight 'em as I kill with kindness Nobody wants a Bitter Benny Or a Debbie Downer Or a Sad Sam that be wrapping a wet blanket around them Keep a sunny disposition -- Breathe Out Cause life has a way of stripping the paint Off of your dream house. It's simple. Indeed these things seem to be easy to see But they easily flee your mind As you find repeated deceit Now there's reasons the weak Of will never dream or believe Before they leap they concede To defeat and agree to retreat Now when fatigue has really got you By the balls/ Remember that if you really didn't believe You'd succeed then you wouldn't have tried at all So jump regardless of the consequence Cause even on the night of the apocalypse Everybody's an optimist. Chorus: Life is wonderful. Life goes full circle. Life is wondeful. X2 Bridge No matter how hard it seems. There's always someone in another position. So when it rains just hold on. When it's gray just hold on. When there's pain just hold on. When it rains. And when it rains think dry skies. When it's gray think bright lights. When there's pain just smile smile. When it rains. Verse: 4 I know it seems everyday is a struggle To keep yourself outta trouble This modern jungle is jumbled with muddled puzzles to stump you And snipers gunning to stumble you Like you've been hunted Dude how the hell are you telling us 'Life is wonderful' Some of you have come to Conclusions/assumptions But nothing as true or stunning That misery becomes something that's comfortable Trumping the will to shun it. Run from it if you're stuck in a rut or two So I figured I'd drum up something I could hum to you. Like this). When it rains just hold on. When it's gray just hold on. When there's pain just hold on.
