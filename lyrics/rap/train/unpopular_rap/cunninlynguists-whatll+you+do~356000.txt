   What’ll you do when the people go home What’ll you do when the show is all done I can’t I won’t I no I’m 25 now yeah I told my pops I’d toss the towel in Making music no longer easily makes my smile bend Though WOW’s from the crowd’s ain’t end yet Them smiles and back pats still ain’t helping the rent checks Ain’t far from crack packs if I hursh these verses Flippin words shit for an empty purse feels worthless Listen word of mouth done been a blessin and a curse We reach heads but the only bread we see’s off shirt sales Tours and shows spread all over the earth well Recoup gas and hotels back to this dirt Hell’s Far away though believe I ain’t complaining Rather explaining that unless this southern rain end We’ll show proof we’s as real as you Needing a roof some shoes dolla bills and food Two from The Dirty met with mismatched skin Acknowledged first that one day this track may end When there’s no more steam in that engine Yet hopefully clean streams be an astringent But needs outweigh cheese tryna stay in contention “For the love” is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension “For the love” is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension “For the love” is a hard reason to keep our lives in suspension yeah What do you do when the people go home And what do you do when the show is all done I know what I’ll do in the alone of my time But what will I do with the leftover wine What’ll you do lay it down What’ll you do lay it down lay it down lay it down again
