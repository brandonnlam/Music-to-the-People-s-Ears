   You live How bout them bullets ain't slow you up You ain't really die and we watched you grow up At twelve months you took ya first steps Awkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best Your first breaths that we can call words In ya fathers lap on November 23rd And They were live for me and he did for you Flipped to neutron and stayed inside the crib for you And this commitment from ya father imparted a deep sense of value you'd forever harbor And we were all so proud as we seen you gettin' smarter And the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter Cause you were not a martyr At six you started reading whole books At seven you knew how a brain looked And could roughly describe all the different regions Could tell when we were sick and even knew the reason The world wasn't at peace Gunfire every weekend But you were hardly there Cause you was always leaving Field museum planetarium aquarium You saw something special in that tank you were starin' in And in those moments as a little girl you realized it was a bigger world Bigger than the southside Bigger than Chicago And you were bigger but still wanted on rims on ya car though And big ass woofers in ya car door So you could wang like ya daddy at the park eating sharks Went to King where you were teased for being smart Where you bumped into Hadiya teaching art. You Live forever At sixteen is when you got you scholarship At twenty-two is when you got ya doctorate Even now it's kinda hard to believe But ya father taught you work hard and achieve And you complied Accepted by every medical school you applied But the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot you replied "They need me in the hood and that's where you reside Free clinic nobody denied And that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside And saw a man and van and a bleeding baby in his hands Fading fast but you knew she could survive Did everything you could to keep this girl alive Stabilized until the ambulance arrived And In that moment where you gave your help bet you didn't know that you saved yourself You live forever Lord have mercy
