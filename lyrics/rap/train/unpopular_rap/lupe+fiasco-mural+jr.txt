    Holy assumption of man into the heaven's sphere Many mansions fit champions within its seven tiers Evangelists re-imagine every 11 years Pause for applause evolves to what was never here Born to death born to die Form the flesh form the eyes A veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives In the dorms of the scorn they keep warm supplies Gone to lose the use of tooth horn and thigh Farthest standing I was landing Two one hand one man bands jamming in tandem He who power naps then plans gathering ransoms And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe Gotta talent traffic and ramblings And handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth Out the back of the wagon Out the back of the madam Out the back of the Magnum Then out the trap of enchantment  with a megaphone megaman Desert zone run marathons with sweaters on sweaters on That was so simple but hot in a place where it's so simple but not Closed temples and ole little forgots and rode whole chissles Cripples with raw missles a lot The old hoes that they won't give you a shot But you can get the whole pistol it's gon' hit you a lot These are real words from a savage mind Unmaximized man on an average climb Who don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time Fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line In the future life I don't even have to rhyme We'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs Just yields and rail roads In lush fields with bell tolls Couple huddles of the unskilled but well told It's unreal how off one deal to sell souls And he got em' by the dozen Medulla oblongata is what got them by the oven Like how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin He gotta buy the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in Such an unsettling scene An obscene setting for the unwedding of rings The sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens The architecture is something you've never seen Dream clean That's three words at the same time They killed three bird with the same And one each in every hand with the same bluffing Answers each and every man with the same question What is it But you still wanna know but I already done did it I ball heavy the physics it's all But it's already specific If we doing what's already done that means it's already terrific That's rather meta-poetic and just to acknowledge that As an extra exhibit to what's already within it The gallery's like the wall space So I made a gallery of galleries made of all space If it was more small it would be Moore's Law From the land of the po' where we war Saw From the hand of a pro to whore jaw Make a stand to the store till the snow thaw Went from paper boy to editor From throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer On the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers One of several sects who can come and charm the predators We who measure the measuring tools of measurers We who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers We who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers We who question the cherished rules of leveragers Born to death born to die Mourn correct immortalized In a war where your performance score is your salary It's like fantasies combatting your mortality I'm just trying to restore sanities Sigmund Freud boy Leroy to your vanity To instill what kills krill destroys manitee So heels spill but still seal deals that build factories What looks Roman senator inner reveals macabees Never just trust off guts but what's actually Unless it's quatos Now we back to pillars of salt I recall back peeling potatoes In hindsight maybe a tank of killer tomatoes A seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty pintos in payloads Now that's another strata but I was making sense Then cop out took the highway and I was making chips A nappy-head Karate Kid I was breaking bricks Can fight like Tekken 5 even taking 6 This rehabilitation I be taking trips "Don't Ruin Us God said I won't make a dent Hardly but I'm still Harvey I hope this making sense Devil tooting his own horn don't come and take a sniff In the streets you gotta fight you get punished for taking whiffs To make that change for your team you gotta have New Jersey driving A stomach for taking whips I'm just trying to redeem With these hands full of bars don't beat me for coming clean To unify the hooks If you know it then come and sing Don't bust in while I'm sleep Nightmares becoming dreams Samurais rarely die from another sword This is 1985 meets the hover board That was Bobby Johnson potato just the underscore Think deep but don't let it fry your motherboards Dip teeth so now the painting's plural But this is Jr's Mural
