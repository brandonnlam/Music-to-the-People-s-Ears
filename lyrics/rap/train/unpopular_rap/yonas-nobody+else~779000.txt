I'm falling off a cliff and I ain't worried 'bout a cushion I'm utterly in love with this limit that I'm pushin No more talkin 'cause the proof is in the pudding Behind a great man they say there's a better woman So women of the world we need you more than ever 'Cause when you heal a man you bring a nation together And when a man is hurt he shovels you his abuse And then we teach the kids that's the trouble with the youth I'm thinking about a way I can help us get the message Maybe through my music I'll eliviate the stresses Everything I've learned I learned from my mothers essence And thanks to her I'm unafraid to ask the tougher questions Believe me you I know it's gettin' hard The type of shit that make you not even believe in God But listen to my words hopefully I change the odds 'Cause the true meaning of faith is believing in your cards Awe... Ain't nobody else gon do The things you do for me and that's my word Forget the thug in your life When you need a little love in your life... Call me So baby it ain't a thing just tell me what's on your mind No hesitation there's dinner reservations at nine Glorious love let's celebrate it with some wine I'll look into your eyes and tell you everything is fine 'Cause everything is fine especially you I'll never take for granted what you blessedly do I speak it from the heart so every message is true And after all it is my heart that led me to you So faith over fear it's pretty simple and plain I love the way you smile and how your dimples arrange The way you find beauty in the things that are strange And when we make love you sing in the perfect range Sorry to be blunt but this is all I know Forget what's on your mind and follow what's in your soul Without a single word I can feel that you know Just like when I close my eyes I can still see you glow woah... Ain't nobody else gon do The things you do for me and that's my word Forget the thug in your life When you need a little love in your life... Call me I see you baby I just wanted to Let you know that you've got my love There's few women out there now days That actually respect themselves And hold themselves in the right light So I just figured I'd shine a little more light your way to keep you up Ain't nobody else gon do The things you do for me and that's my word Forget the thug in your life When you need a little love in your life... Call me
