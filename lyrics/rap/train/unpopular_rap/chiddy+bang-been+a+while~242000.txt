   It's been a while since I seen you It's been a while since I heard from you It's been a while since I checked back in And I ain't heard a word from you It's been a while since I was in it I hit it and then I pushed it to the limit Shit I wonder what you do now Damn Shit I wonder who you do now My ex bitch yeah she moved on She bad and bougie like Grey Poupon I can't say it but you thought I'm superman I'm smarter than that think I'm a stupid man New edition but I'm a veteran I feel fresher than I have ever been I fly places those niggas have never been At the door you gotta let them in I feel like my niggas could do Letterman I prefer tequila for my medicine Stick to the script and watch it pan out Now I got them reaching with their hands out Touchdown throw it in the end zone I evacuated the friend zone Now I'm getting ends though Apparently all that matters we like the Winslows And every time the wind blows I just wonder where did my friends go I just wonder where did my ends go I just wonder where did my friends go It's been a while since I seen you It's been a while since I heard from you It's been a while since I checked back in And I ain't heard a word from you Stay down to it In a circle so small they gotta come around to it We was getting on day and night And then we found music In the studio don't it got a nice sound to it I used to ride around the city in a brown Buick T I owe you but I just didn't get around to it I'd of mixed my emotions and I switched stains I'd of swerved on those haters and I switched lanes New edition but I'm a veteran I feel fresher than I have ever been I fly places them niggas have never been At the door you gotta let them in I took my family out of deficit We flying no matter what the weather is Moving up Jeffersons Piss greatness and shit excellence Been a while since I seen you It's been a while since I heard from you It's been a while since I checked back in And I ain't heard a word from you
