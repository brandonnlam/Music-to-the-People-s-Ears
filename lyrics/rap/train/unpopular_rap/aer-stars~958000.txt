I could give you what you want If you give me what you need I could take away your pain And still bring you to your knees I don't need no guns or drugs I just need my own company and I'm free Oh yeah I'm free I could never give in The fruit of our labor always the ripest Time after time I'm clocking in the night shift Blow that green for the environmental crisis Motorcycle license lemme see where Mike is 'Cause we got problems but they all artificial They all stop when he pull out the whistle Our team to the game fires the missiles Armed with a pistol scarrin' that tissue Nikes with the red are my choice on the road Color of the revolution yeah my voice should be heard From misters to misses to hipsters and more This efficient you wish you had this in store But you don't so move on we always rock steady Born for this purpose I'm way beyond ready This is way beyond trendy way beyond Fendi Way beyond any story that'll come to an ending 'Cause the stars gon' shine just a little overhead Get your mind right limelight ain't nothing but a test It's okay for you to doubt me but my inner demons live Through this music and I use it to get ahead Fair weather friends see the sun shining Need find a way to prescribe the mind when crunch time hits No stress lets find out what unsigned is Been dreaming about this since the lunch line with the lights on my kicks I get congratulated but I need to work harder It's time to open up 'cause I can't breathe with all this armor on Shield in hand wielded sword waiting for a milestone Keep peace there's no way in hell Imma die alone I heard of something but I'm still unaware of specifics I don't care if it's by the Atlantic or the Pacific The FAM crew will be a perfect addition It's obvious that I slur semantics Tryna make everything work to my advantage Careers with no spark tend to fade out and vanish So don't take on more than you can manage 'Cause the stars gon' shine just a little overhead Get your mind right limelight ain't nothing but a test It's okay for you to doubt me but my inner demons live Through this music and I use it to get ahead
