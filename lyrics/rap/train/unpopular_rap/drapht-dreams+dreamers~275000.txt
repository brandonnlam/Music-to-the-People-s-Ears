   In the evening when I wake up And my golden rainbow dawns In the proceeding moments just revolve I lose myself Is this a dream or reality how do we tell the difference Every day seemed like Christmas now it's Halloween Galleries with blank canvas gallivant ran Through the valley for a Salary that grants me Successful in this majestic culture Survive if you're high like the nest of a vulture Pauly Poltergeist a voltage of lighting Not scared to strike twice like assaultings from bikies I'm hiking with a viking mind state Hunt to feed his family the life of a primate I'm just a tired ape lie awake late No sleep when ya life's fate decided on a break Is this a nightmare Pinch my hand and breathe Feel like I'm getting lynched by my girl's family I gotta dream and it might seem thin But I couldn't breathe without it it's my Siamese twin I sleep no more dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the explosion when the commotion errupts I sleep no more dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the man dumping his shit unloading his truck I sleep no more Absence of occupation isn't rest  a mind vacant is another mind of distress  no rest for the wicked yeah we could just kick it Or we could fucken stick it to the man Is this life I'm watching bum's rifle threw rubbish Malnourished another vicious growl from their stomachs How rubbish another vicious row with the government Rummage through our cans and the council ain't loving it Nothing under this sun done change Monday to Sunday life's mundane In one day Mundine took down Green In one day a stingray took our Steve Proven even our hero's are human Proven some come dumber than Sam Newman Ya loose ya win loose again Is this life the booze or hallucinogen So I move with the wind like willow But sin like bellow my head hits the pillow And I'm gone out for the count like Drak Bounce and I'm out like that do ya feel me Yeah is this a dream Jump from a bridge will I hit the street or wake up It just seems That I'm wasting my time praying for something greater Yeah is this a dream Will I be the man that I wanted to be as a kid It's not how it seems Don't wanna be remembered as another man that lived I sleep no more dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the explosion when the commotion errupts I sleep no more dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the man dumping his shit unloading his truck I sleep no more Rest is excellent but bordom is his brother Death his cousin age is his mother Cover your eyes go to sleep sweet heart But when you wake you might find the grim reaper Standing at the end of your bed demanding to be fed Your soul sucked from that hole in ya head Not even Ned Kelly's armour could save ya The arm of the saviour lay ya to rest so save ya breath To say your prayers even Satan says Realities a very sad state of affairs So beware of the screaming hyenas And only sleep seperates the dreams from the dreamers I sleep no more dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the explosion when the commotion errupts I sleep no more dream with eyes open No more pills and no more potion No more being woken up By the man dumping his shit unloading his truck I sleep no more "In the evening when I wake up I dream with eyes I dream with eyes open I sleep no more "In the evening when I wake up I dream with eyes I dream with eyes open "In the evening when I wake up And my golden rainbow dawns In the proceeding moments just revolve I lose myself
