   I like... Making you so happy Yo life and debt light a cigarette smoke the stress Take a deep breath baby let's rearrange the mess we've Inherited Alienated from what is rightfully yours in my land Is life money is time paid for labor Working eight to five sometimes six seven eight We come home and barely know the neighbors Bills are usually late Interest accumulates at a usury rate Collection agency waits from Pay check to next one budget like a noose Working while we sing the proletariat blues On 501-C3 community plantations Non profit sector propped up to kill the movement for The changes in production relations But woman you're my comrade ride and die revolution- Making mother earth Standing with me in the grocery line While I'm paying with a jar of pennies nickels and Dimes And I love how you don't like art without a message I love how you call some fellas... Femme-ish  Third world sister never sacrificing substance for Style But stylish with a golden type smile I love how you organize with other strong sisters Love how you talk about tearing down the system Like a soldier my dialectical reflection yes is the Answer to your question Life and debt write another check to the landlord No time to dwell on all the things we can't afford Gotta baby in the womb a soldier for the future that We're fighting for Concrete conditions that are fighting for  The payback it's way past due And they say that the masses ain't ready but We know that ain't true you and I both children of Filipino immigrants from the same island our ancestors Smiling Cuz we found one another in a strange land struggling Moms tryin' to tell us not to protest instead pray for Peace But that ain't the nature of the beast So lady grab a bullhorn and take it to the streets Yellin power to the people el pueblo unido hamas and Abansito Til the wealth is spread equal You 21st century Gabriela Salaw Pierced like Lorena with a rifle in the arm And I love how you love the people as much as self I love that how you want redistribution of the wealth Third world sister never sacrificing substance for Style But stylish with a golden type smile I love that how you organize with other strong sisters Love that how you talk about tearing down the system Like a soldier my dialectical reflection yes is the Answer to your question Life and debt I like... Making you so happy I like... Making you so happy I like... Making you so happy Cuz making you so happy makes me happy too
