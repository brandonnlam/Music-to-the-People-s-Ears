   New chapter new page Made some money off the first mixtape Now I'm livin' good chillin' by a beach that's not a lake Said the Earth controls the moon so we control the waves So let me say that shit again Hope they listen to what I'm sayin' While that blood flow through you Please don't live your life in vain And if I get better with age But all my visions ancient Then we could freeze time to see these pictures that we painted They release a little bit of dopamine and inspiration Damn what a sensation keep it Ben Franklin You can get it too Life been like a dream lately That's 'cause I'm livin' lucid And you control your world swear I'm livin' proof And I remember In Living Color on in the livin' room Damn I miss my mother now we at them parties you can't get into Makin' bitches kiss each other Damn what you finna do Look up in the stars and make your problems seem minuscule like What makes us love What makes us dream I found the light Now it's all I see So we ride that wave that wave When that tide comes in And that water deep So be prepared to swim Be prepared to swim So be prepared to swim So be prepared to swim The mind's receptive You can catch a signal 'Cause waves ripple if you pay attention See this that deep water Tread lightly got good karma And some clean chakras a clear psyche I can see everything comin' to me Like Oh my goodness I see world tours fast cars and big booties But I'm just focused on my contribution my contribution And if I die tonight just promise me that you'll listen to it I put my heart and now my soul in it this shit weighted And if I try to live forever will someone save me Look I'm a hustler by trade An artist by night and dreamer by day But these days I can't tell the difference soon as I wake And I say that because yeah I know that somethin' awaits And the rest of the gang straight look how far we done came What makes us love What makes us dream I found the light Now it's all I see So we ride that wave When that tide comes in And that water deep So be prepared to swim Be prepared to swim So be prepared to swim So be prepared to swim So be prepared to swim So be so
