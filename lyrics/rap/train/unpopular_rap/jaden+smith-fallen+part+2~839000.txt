    Let your heart just rest on mine girl The more I love the more I like Let your heart just rest on mine girl The more I love the more I like Let your heart just rest on mine girl Look at yours it's alright I just wanna hold you tight girl The more I love the more I like Let your heart just rest on mine girl The more I love the more I like Let your heart just rest on mine Remember the time when I held you tight  You're my reminder I need to find Girl you came so close I still got your clothes sitting in my room while I play this music You're not my girl no more Let the rain just pour Don't you worry 'bout how I feel tonight Said I love you You're all I know I still got your clothes sitting in my room while I play this music I can't find you at home Unless I know you're gone I just wanna see you in my bed
