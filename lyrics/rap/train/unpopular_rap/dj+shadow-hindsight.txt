   Don't think of the could've beens Don't think of what should've been Weed out your weaknesses Piled up issue makes a mess Don't think you had a chance Don't dwell on lost romance Nothing is guaranteed Or caters to stupidity They say life is what you make it Can't go back and try to change it Learn to live with your regrets Choose a path choose it right It's all there in black and white Disassociate joy and wealth Just don't even kid yourself They say life is what you make it Can't go back and try to change it Choices that were made Opportunities Push away the pain and move on With no delay Move on accept the shame Learn to live with your regrets Move on with no delay Move on accept the shame It's all behind you anyway
