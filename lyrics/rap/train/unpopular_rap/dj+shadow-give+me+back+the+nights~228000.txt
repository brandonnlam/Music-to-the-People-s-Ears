   Give me back the nights give me back the agony of my solitary The nights I spent or love The million endless solitary nights of my life Give me back all the people I desire that never came Give me back your love for love which was never really giving And even the lessons what you gave there was the taking For you surprise and loving someone more helpless than yourself Give me back the nights Give me back the agony of the years of lonely weary Give me back the thousand rejections of my life Give me back the love which I deserved Give me back the time the lost time and energy And beauty of my youth wasted in the wind And spilled out in imitation when nothing was coming And the waging the waging give me back the nights  I'm sure of lane together building the great temple of our love Give me back the nights the nights the nights The nights the nights the nights the love grow Endless that nights
