   America I love you Even after everything you put my blood through Every descendant of a slave ought to cuss you Throw a middle finger up and say America my love's true Even after everything you put my blood through Every descendant of a slave ought to cut you Pull out an AK and spray But that ain't love And on this long road to perdition You might wanna use my navigation system my wisdom Shine light through this black prism My rhythm let it guide you through baptism Word to Shirley Chisolm I'm truly tryna blaze trails Write back senders of the hate mail that keeps comin' Caged bird still singing chain gang still drummin' 100 miles and we still runnin 400 years give me a pound of Bob Marley American flags strapped to the back of black Harleys And if we burn you down it's to begin anew Let's pull the sheet off of our history and bid adieu America I love you Even after everything you put my blood through Every descendant of a slave ought to cuss you Throw a middle finger up and say America my love's true Even after everything you put my blood through Every descendant of a slave ought to cut you Pull out an AK and spray But that ain't love Banner in the sky the U.S is alive Everything before it absorb it or let it die Daughter of four fathers no momma to get it right Raised and became a beauty with something ugly inside Growing up abused with bruises of different hues Read white lies now our lady sings the blues Over C notes while we broke and see votes for people Both villain and hero competing stroking her ego That talk the talk come time to walk do absolutely zero Cheer us on the court but when it's foul we get no free throw But we go hard off hope and for the love With all my heart still covered in blood Like a beauty from the heavens up above But hold her tight you 'bout to see close up Past smooth skin you'll find something so rough Can we keep her true I don't know what to do I don't know what to do and she don't either Red white blues red white blues Red white and blues
