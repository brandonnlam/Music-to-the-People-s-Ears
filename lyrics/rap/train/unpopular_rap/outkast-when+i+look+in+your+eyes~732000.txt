    Hey... Uh Huh... Well Alright... How Y'all Doing Yes Mam You're Mighty Fine I've been around the world seen so many pretty girls But I still get over whelmed when I look in your eyes Been from main to Spain but everything seems the same I only feel the change when I look in your eyes I know your upper class I know you got those abs Every man wants to kiss you and I do too Sometimes I'm just a clown and everybody puts me down I guess I'll come around when I look in your eyes Tell me what's a man to do to get close to you I'm just a lonely fool when I look in your eyes Don't tell me no this time if you do it will blow my mind Have you ever seen a grown man cry It's an awful thang I guess it's time to say good bye but I gotta give it one more try I'm only satisfied when I look in your eyes Oh please come home with me oh don't you wanna marry me I'm even gonna rub your feet when they stank outkast How can I let you down I guess I'm always gonna be around I'm simply astounded when I look in your eyes
