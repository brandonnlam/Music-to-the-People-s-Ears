   Send corrections to the typist  There's an old saying in Tennesse I know it's in Texas it's probably in Tennesse That says fool me once Shame... on Shame... on you If. you fool me you can't fool me again .  I live in a nation that relies on business and crime And the leaders are politician guys livin' a lie Who bullshit like everyone else for a nickel and dime America Just... as corrupt as it is online Using freedom and entertainment just to keep us sedated But remember what the declaration of independence stated All men are equal and that's the way they're created But when that was written black and white people were segregated And this country still breeds racism just not as blatant To call us the land of the free is overstatement Cause ain't nobody free We. all being watched quietly National security's an invasion of privacy Drug Trafficking conspiracy murder and piracy What America can't have they take silently Sometimes violently open up your eyes and see Even dirty money is supporting our economy It's all backwards like negative split photography But I guess that's the way it's got to be United we stand on this land and we do all crimes Facin' a Dyin' Nation  I live in a nation where it ain't what's physical that fights us Now it's silent strikes from political insiders A black market government where being criminal is righteous Ran by bloodlines that were dirty before Isis The crisis has even spread to spiritual infestations Confessionals filled with sexual molestations Professionals so set on capitalization They don't notice their children freebasin' in their million Dollar basements Babies having babies in the hood I grew up in Hands are too small for the guns that they be bustin' Schools underfunded graduates retain nothing On Capitol Hll it's barely a topic of discussion Kids like why should I think about college When this hood situation is holding me hostage And even if I fought and bought the knowledge I'd prolly get shot 41 times by a cop over my wallet Shiiiiit So.. wherever you are Don't inhale the second hand smoke from it's victory cigar Motivate yourself don't just stand on the side Facing a dying nation and listening to the new told lies
