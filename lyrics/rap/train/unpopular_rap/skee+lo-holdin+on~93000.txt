   Skee-Lo Bonsai and oh my Yippee Kai yai yay Hello hello hello Hooray hooray hooray I am here to interrupt your regular program So hey man now don't you touch that dial Unless we step in single file Keep it pretty slowly Cause you know I like to focus on the ease And you can call me Skee if you please So come on in come on in Come in and give a pound mix and mingle with your friends Or just have a drink or just sit down Get up stand up come on throw your hands up If ya girl is throwin fronts then your brothers keep your chin up Be cool with the flexin she's in the mood for sexin You could pop the question but that's just my suggestion And when the mood is right we can switch it off to candle light But hold on to your girls cause if you don't well then I might I know that you just might be in the mood-a To want to shoot a spark into the dark But this is just a start
