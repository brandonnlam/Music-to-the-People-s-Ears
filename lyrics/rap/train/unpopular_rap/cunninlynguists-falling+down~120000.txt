    &lt;Scratching&gt But I was nearly crazy And I was clearly crazy On I-85 North going nowhere Would hit the 400 but I ain't got money for the toll there Traffic backed up ahead of me I see the road flares School bus on my right kids laughin' with brown and gold hair Replaying conversations in my head by my ex-wife From the house work that I did to the kids even our sex life She said I was crazy so I threatened to prove her dead-right So she got court orders restraining me put on the red lights Frustrated thinking how the fuck could I clean it up Traffic stopped about 1000 degrees in my truck Loosened my tie wiped the sweat out of my eyes mixed with tears Mind thick with fears I've lost everything that I done built for years Bright yellow school bus fucking up my limbo Kids bitchin' cussin' flickin' boogers upon my window Start rolling it down for some air and the handle breaks Kick my door open dive out feeling some escape "We said vows and shit that shits' for life right Yeah that shit's until death death... That shit can be mended But that bitch don't be listening to me She'll prolly throw a fucking fit and shit I'ma go there that bitch is gonna listen to me She'll see I'ma fix this shit FUCK THAT Today's about to be one of the biggest days of my life 'Cause I'm about to ask the women I love if she'll be my wife I just know that she will for this women I'll KILL I used to clean dishes at Micky D's now I'm on GRILL So I've been able to save up enough money for this necklace Along with this ring for when I pop the big question But my manager's been stressin' the way I been dressin' Tellin' me I need new shoes but I can't afford to get them He's all about perfection and does shit that I hate Today he wrote me up and I was only five minutes late And then he threatened to take me off grill and make me scrub plates And the toilet where people shit out all the food they just ate AW FUCK I'm starting to hear my screws bust Screw it I'll do it He gives me Windex and a toothbrush Now I'm scrubbin the toilet like FUCK MY BOSS and HE STINKS I'm asking my girl to marry me fuck what everyone thinks Let me look at the ring now to calm me down like my shrink NOOOOOO I JUST LOST IT AND NOW IT'S LOST IN THE SINK And today on my lunchbreak my girl's supposed to come through I want to ask her but without the ring what'll I do Dialogue:
