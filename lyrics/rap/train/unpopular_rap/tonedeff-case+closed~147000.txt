   Let's get a bit acquainted Hey it's t-o-n-e-d-e-double-the-eff with the famous flow Known to be flipping syllables even when the pace is slow Gracious No Save your soul guess who is coming to take this throne Break this whole motherfuckin' game down and reclaim crowns Cause I'm sick of layin' down  watching these companies reign now When it's obvious something is playin' out on the stage while you're unconscious they shoving to gain ground And sedate crowds with the same sound they've been layin up into your brain loud Enough to take any rational thought  and leave your brain clouded to rap as just pop Isn't it insane how niggas be keeping their face frowned perpetrating their need to erase clowns they remain proud till the minute you see them in lace gowns All the sudden they flee to escape town they're ashamed cause they got busted Just because of that and not really because they regret what they've done is disgusting This discussion's meant to function as a general centerpiece sent at these enemies bent on resenting me better be set if we enter the end of peace Settling isn't an option no more We gon' box in this war  you'll be hearing them bells before we knock on your door Buckle Up Brace Yourself Knuckle Up Take No L's Dust to Dust Say Farewell Don't fuck with us Save Yourself Buckle Up Tight We're gonna tussle We gonna Fight Until you never touch another mic Or it's your life…Then Case Closed. This is the way we ever gonna see that it stops And if not you might as well give up on hip-hop Cause this is the case in this day and age We gotta kick in your face if you're just in for fame Now that you been initiated up into this movement Get at your favorite idiot who's spits Hit him a little bit with your 2 fists Kick in his grill until he is toothless Give him a min to get up and cue this Single out eve-ry limb that's wounded Whip him again with a heavy pool stick dig on his bitch and then beg he do shit Ruthless roots of abuse set loose for execution Of any groups that get us confused with petty fools who'll let you crew win Check the movements fluent as I ever was I said it Because- You would never think that a nigga that never drink would ever step it up to get a better buzz On the regular the odds you've leapt ahead of us are prolly less than Oedipus hating his mother Or Disney hiring sexual predators Senators getting elected a 3rd consecutive term A nurse who doesn't do enemas Permanent henna a surfer that catches more waves then your current antennae does Sure…I make it look effortless with every sentence that tends to be cleverly Penned…. More wreckless then Session ingesting hennesey blends More treacherous than even being the Kennedy Men And for any requesting the identity of the technically Best MC Guess but…Yep it's Me. Step to see the a new strain of the plague raised to abuse breaks Unphased of what you say cause I dead lines all without a due date I'm the new age. New school. New page. New rules. Any attempt to try to pull away is just a doomed fate for a few fools QN5 represent the true scene so we're guaranteed one of two things Either we're showered with praise or we're simply hated by every review team What I've stated was meant to reduce kings into paupers and to seduce queens to get topless And to revolutionize everything you think hip-hop is.
