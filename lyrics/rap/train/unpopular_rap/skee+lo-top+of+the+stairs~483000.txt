   Skee-Lo Growin up as a kid tough skins and Afros Wasn't South Central but still it came natural There wasn't nobody to watch my back Didn't wanna be strapped to get jacked Mama taught me not to trust no man Brother what's your plan If you ever lose a fight then you go back again and win And I don't care if it was one of your friends You better bury your feelings within And understand that on top of the stairs They got keys to Catalacs bmw's Mercedes Benz and all of that And on top of the stairs yeah They got colour tv's and even girls come in two pairs And on the bottom you've got nothin but guilt Bad feelings bein kept homies been killed When I die always know that I never was see my little brother drop So you better stay on top
