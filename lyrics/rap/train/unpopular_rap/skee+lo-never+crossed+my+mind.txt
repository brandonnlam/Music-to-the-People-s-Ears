   I used to think that I was hard The kind of kid you don't wanna mess wit' I'll fight you and your bodyguard I was illeterate we're talkin' gibberish But never considerate of the way I treated friends I would fight ten kids and I would fly all heads I would even fight dragons 'til they'd be dead I would presidents and the mayor you bet But it's just too bad because I ain't fought yet You see I took a slug at no one But if I ever did I'll have to show one That I was like able to wreck it I thought I knew but I didn't know That all the talk in the world doesn't make you a pro And so 'cause my first real fight in the hood I would bash a skull if I could But that's when these kids wrecked my world swept my feet up Straight got illed and I was nearly killed It never crossed my mind
