   I had a vision I tried to warn 'em but they didn't listen So now they view from the sidelines watching it all come together It's time for the intervention it's time for a new religion I met the stars but I feel the same come off the plane and it feel different To come home and feel distant I'm trapped in my head but swear I'm still in it And I'ma stay here so get used to me Ain't the same person that I used to be but still humanly we breathe the same air Looking at the game like a daycare The team too strong they like Towk you ain't playing fair Watch me just manifest Frankenstein make it come to life Float to the skies like Pegasus I might burn alive Won't regret my mistake trust in the sciences Gotta feel that heat just to know how hot that fire get And I'ma keep supplying it because it's high in demand I got a hunger that could silence the lambs And if I fail bet I try it again They prolly try and attack they shoot shots bet I fire 'em back Like Pop pop pop Hit 'em like oh my god pull yo' card Why you tryna act that hard So show some proof want it we can go there too That's not the move been holding back but now I'm 'bout to let it loose And if you want it what you tryna do And if you got it then just show me some proof I just ready I got my head in it makin' no more regrettin' And really I'm 'bout to let it loose I'm 'bout to let it loose Now I'm 'bout to let it loose Really I'm 'bout to let it loo
