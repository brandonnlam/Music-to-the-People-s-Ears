And I tried to make you understand that I'm not sorry No I'm not sorry baby I'm not sorry I'm not sorry I dropped my walls opened locks let you in Shared with you all those thoughts about movin' in Put all my trust in you while we were a fling 'Cause I don't pretend say it to the end I'm not sorry Apologies won't come from me Don't believe ya to be someone of a quality You're lower than the European economies I know what you do when you visit your friends at their colleges Spittin red cup mythology And they all eat it up like piranhas see Don't acknowledge me anymore I can't fuck with you I don't know what to do You were way too quick to get comfortable We all know this shits nothing new Girl I've done enough for you And I'm hardly getting repaid Many days since we laid Are now we in fifth grade You're just afraid It's a difference of opinion I think ya wish it was different But ya kissed him in the kitchen So I went along and broke it Sorry I don't wanna continue this intermission I'm in the middle of switching to someone more open You thought I wouldn't notice But I only focus on what I keep closest You're a plague and I don't need no locusts Go find out whats at the bottom of the ocean And I tried to make you understand that I'm not sorry No I'm not sorry baby I'm not sorry I'm not sorry I dropped my walls opened locks let you in Shared with you all those thoughts about movin' in Put all my trust in you while we were a fling 'Cause I don't pretend say it to the end I'm not sorry Where do we go now You know I wile out every time that I go south Ain't nothin to talk about 'cause I'm on my own now A situation that I had a just pull out I always knew that it wouldn't last So you can get that tattoo w you own cash Didn't wanna admit it but you've got no ass It's hard to get used to someone who moves so fast So You're dead to me it's not destiny Ya took ecstasy in Chesapeake You don't need a tell me the rest of it And know my recipe is excellent You're another notch on my headboard Don't test me payback had to be the next thing Never ever let her get near me again Oh shit don't hold me back Peace and quiet you owe me that Leaving you the loneliest Girl fall back like the foliage Ya can't change the past You're never shakin that I hate ya now I'm not sorry
