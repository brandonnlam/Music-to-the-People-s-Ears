    Compose yourself like a self-aware opera conjurer In the zone like Sonic to produce me A sign of the end times In time to make profit off the t-shirts And monetize all our research And leave Earth feet first Breech behold whites get whiter in the cold And colors don't fade in the bleach hah Applause then fall through a man-made self Talking to a doll at the pancake house Then bring the light saber-ers So bring the lampshades out Mood To say something lewd on the news And move like views on a cruise And fuse like the Q's and the U's Oh ah oh ah oh ahh  Which side are you on We're getting warmer 'Cause I can't hold on Are you close to me Sunset so long Can you call me 'Cause I lost my phone Should I wait for you Or should I go home I can't function These drugs are too strong I'm seeing stars now But I'm still unknown Out here alone Sunset so long  Mates for life Chillin' life space with ice High as a kite Snakes hiss like air at the St. Claire When you put it in their face like skin care But then just take 'em on like a hinge chair I've done that I've been there This's a comeback let me unpack And unwrap souvenirs Free as a speech untap Flat like time on the run Why you bring a holster to a gun rack That's the alpha and omega That's the Vodka and the vomit Why you playing soccer with the sonics That's a iPod to the Amish You should get involved with the honest Where everything's honored like Elijah Muhammad Mixed with a pint of Hooked on phonics Let's be liars That's not chronic condone Islamic and it's haunted  Which side are you on We're getting warmer 'Cause I can't hold on Are you close to me Sunset so long Can you call me 'Cause I lost my phone Should I wait for you Or should I go home I can't functionThese drugs are too strong  Sun god Sam and the California drug deals Rain drop Wayne and the bank cock love bills She knows that I'm crooked like Owen But still goin' like a paradox Parasite know it ain't right Where the fan now she knows that I'm horny like  Together but separated like a pair of socks wow Like pot using both hands And his head is the oath I only follow with escorts now call it sticking to the program Fucking all the police send digits to the pole dancers Come here like  You love it over here like gold watch I would treat the box like it's UPS I would treat the box like a sneaker head If you shake and throw it like a match with a cigarette Then drop it like a match on a gas trail Fix another round for the mob You the bomb Let you heart you heart up and down to the door to the back fell Still wanna put my meat up in your V like I'm Maxvell Stick a fork in it dawg it's important to y'all But it's porkin' so it ain't important at all So underground laying with a torch in the hall When unfortunate calls from the horoscope cars and the fortunes and balls Outfit so small saw a portion of drawers  off the track and put the Porsche in the wall like skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt  Which side are you on We're getting warmer 'Cause I can't hold on Are you close to me Sunset so long Can you call me 'Cause I lost my phone Should I wait for you Or should I go home I can't functionThese drugs are too strong
