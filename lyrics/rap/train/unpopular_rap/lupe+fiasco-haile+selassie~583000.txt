    Haile Selassie High high as the eyelids of osprey I'm driving Poseidon your trident can't stop me from diving Lookin' for my Lookin' for my Lookin' for my As I float Brand new shell for my ghost Tattoos all on my coast Throughout history It has been the inaction of those who could have acted The indifference of those who should have known better The silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most This has made it possible for evil to triumph Selassie Man's limitation transfiguration I can dance done  welcome to the demo Modern man comes to the weddin' in the limo Mixin' doves with the rice rain Uncle Ben's off the rails on the night train And that storm took us to the platform pushas Back to the bachelor's backdoor unhook us Hope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us And that's very old like Blackberry Bold but the juice  Sweeter than where the party at or Releasing these niggas from the rooms and Leavin' these niggas on the loose or Keepin' these niggas in the coops and Leavin' these niggas on the noose free Shamu fan got a world to see Haile Selassie High high as the eyelids of osprey I'm driving Poseidon your trident can't stop me from diving Lookin' for my Lookin' for my Lookin' for my As I float Brand new shell for my ghost Tattoos all on my coast Then until the philosophy which holds one race superior And another inferior Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned That until there no longer First class and second class citizens of any nation Until the color of a man's skin Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes Selassie To the limit The limit in the Methadone clinic Ridin' with the pack like a Pelitan Flyin' with the sack in the trap like the pregnant As it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon If I triple my worth will it cripple my mom If I simple my search will it mental my calm Will it hurt if I give you my palm To tell  and don't put a nail in it How you gonna see the world if you wailin' And readin' my palms like there's braille in it Is it the trail or the forest Or the forest with the trail in it That's a sail with a 12 in it Water coming through from impalin' it Nothin' left of the boat but my Still I fill up the world and I float like Haile Selassie High high as the eyelids of osprey I'm driving Poseidon your trident can't stop me from diving Lookin' for my Lookin' for my Lookin' for my As I float Brand new shell for my ghost Tattoos all on my coast A qualified man with vision Unmoved by daily selfish interests Led to right decisions by his conscience In general a man who knows from whence he comes And where he's going Will cooperate with his fellow human beings He will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties But will inspire others by his good example You are being watched by the nation And you should realize That you will satisfy it if you do good But on the contrary you do evil it will lose its hope and confidence in you Selassie Hydrant open wide On the side of the colonized Swimmin' in the street fell asleep on my mama thighs Blockin' out the noise that destroys little boys Live enjoy ships ahoy get deployed by the rock-a-byes D-d-d-deep into the sea of my dreams Lyin' fall asleep at the feet of my queen Hawk comin' right to the beat of your wings Song for the Ethiopian King Haile Haile Selassie High high as the eyelids of osprey I'm driving Poseidon your trident can't stop me from diving Lookin' for my Lookin' for my Lookin' for my As I float Brand new shell for my ghost Tattoos all on my coast Haile Selassie High high as the eyelids of osprey I'm driving Poseidon your trident can't stop me from diving Lookin' for my Lookin' for my Lookin' for my As I float Brand new shell for my ghost Tattoos all on my coast
