   F/ Cashmere the Professional  Send corrections to the typist Dear Dad Yeah it's me surprised that I'm writin' Well not really I'm sittin' at my computer just typin' Heard you were sick Would have found out last week had I called But to be honest I don't feel the least bad at all Yeah I know that sounds fucked up but you made me like that Look at my childhood I can't believe you played me like that You was never around promises was all you resort No child support not as much as a call to my moms I went through nights with no dinner lookin' bummy and skips Could go no where in school with no money for trips Gettin' cracked on by honeys and shit Strugglin' That's why I don't listen to your lectures on hustlin' Cause we had nothin' Stuck in the hood always And you refer to the 80s as the good ole' days Well they wasn't for me I guess things went all your way But I ain't done keep reading I got more to say I know this all seems abrasive But look what I'm faced with Missed opportunities Missed chances missed places I looked at what others had and I couldn't get basic Deprived of so much that's why I'm stuck with this hatred I went through problem after problem thinkin' you wouldn't care All simply because you wasn't there Just promise to visit and sorrys couldn't redeem you It probably would have been better if I would never had seen you Cause then I wouldn't have a face to place with the lies And the disappointment that affected our lives I guess that's why I'm so bothered now And want to hit a motherfucker sayin' you your fathers child So I gotta be keepin' the faith For them three girls of mine and I won't be repeatin' mistakes That you made with me cause I don't miss my past And every third Sunday in June you can kiss my ass Scratched And I could feel it as a child growin' up Xzibit 'Paparazzi' Many moon have cycled since the night you decided To break out late and fade out into the silence First born son still playin' in his diapers Left behind ya Kinda thought I'd never find ya But guess what The human being you had deemed a mistake Is now staring you in your face It's a disgrace the way I was treated shit you probably wish I got caught in the condom when my pops skeeted Well fuck that I buck back all odds And stuck straight through your facade of camouflage You ain't my mom You ain't nothin' but a heartless bitch I'm starting to switch Don't even start this shit Tryin' to fabricate facts that my dad kidnapped me It can't be nothin' but lies to try to trap me In face he Packed me to Cali in '84 We found your crib but you never came to the door Wouldn't answer the phone but you had to be home Tragedy sewn Yo you had to know you were wrong Reminisce and it's not surprising Grew up so broke I thought the poverty line was the horizon Many nights and days we stayed in shacks Pops breakin' his back Faded ass packs of food stamps But karma's a double edge sword So thanks for letting me borrow your fuckin' umbilical cord
