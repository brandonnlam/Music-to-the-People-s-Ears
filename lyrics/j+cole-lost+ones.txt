    Baby girl I can't imagine what it's like for you I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you I know you wonder if this is gon' make me think About wifing you... Like if you have my first child would I Spend my whole life with you Now I ain't trying to pick a fight with you I'm trying to talk. Now I ain't trying to spend the night With you I'm kinda lost see I've been giving it some thought lately and Frankly I feel like we ain't ready and this... Hold up now let me finish Think about it baby me and you still kids ourselves How we gonna raise a kid by outself handle biz by ourself A nigga barely over 20 where the hell we gonna live Where am I gonna get that money I refuse to bring my boy and my girl in this world When I ain't got shit to give em And I'm not with them niggas who be knocking girls up And skate out so girl you gotta think about your options Weigh it out what's the weigh-out And I ain't too proud to say that I cried sometimes Cried sometimes about it And girl I know it hurts but If this world was perfect we can make it work She say you got some nerve To come up to me talking about abortion This my body nigga so don't think you finna Force shit See I knew that this is how you act So typical said you love me but now You flipping like reciprocals figures though Should've known that you was just another nigga No different from them other niggas who be Claiming that they love you just to get up in Them drawers. Knowing all the right things to say I let you hit it raw muthafucka Now I'm pregnant you don't wanna get involved muthafucka Trying to take away a life is you God muthafucka I don't think so this a new life up in my stomach Regardless if I'm your wife this new life here I'mma love it I ain't budging I just do this by my muthafucking self See my mama raised me with no muthafucking help From a man but I still don't understand how you Could say that did you forget all those conversations That we had way back about your father And you told me That you hate that nigga talking about he a coward And you so happy that you ain't that nigga cause he Left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit Now here you go doing the same shit... You ain't shit nigga  And I ain't too proud to say that I cried sometimes Cried sometimes about it And girl I know it hurts but If this world was perfect we can make it work They say everything happens for a reason And people change like the seasons they grow Apart she wanted him to show his Heart and say he loved her he spoke them Magic words and on the same day he fucked her Now she wide open she put a ring up on his finger If she could but he loved her cause the pussy good But she ain't no wife though uh oh She telling him she missed her period like typos He panicking froze up like a mannequin A life grows inside now he asking is it even mine What if this bitch ain't even pregnant dog Could she be lying And she be crying cause he acting Distant like ever since I told you this nigga You acting different". And all his niggas saying These hoes be trapping niggas. Playing with niggas' Emotions like they some action figures Where they get pregnant for collateral It's like extortion man If that bitch really pregnant tell her to get An abortion... But what about your seed nigga
