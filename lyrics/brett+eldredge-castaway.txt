I tried to fly but I ran out of sky And I fell straight down into the ocean Then I rode a wave back to shore And I stayed for awhile Till I got tired of being lonely Why do I always try To run away from you Please don't say a castaway Is what I was born to do I guess I'll always be lost without you If I got smart I'd trade my wings for your heart And I'd promise to never chase the wind I look up at the moon but all I see is you And I'm reminded I need your love again Why do I always try To run away from you Please don't say a castaway Is what I was born to do I guess I'll always be lost without you I'd be naive to ever think You're at your door waiting for me So why do I always try To run away from you Please don't say a castaway Is what I was born to do I guess I'll always be lost without you
