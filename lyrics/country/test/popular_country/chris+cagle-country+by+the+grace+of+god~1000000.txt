   Hot sun goin' down heatin' up this little town The cows are fed and the plowin's all been done Moon light fireflies beer on the bank by the riverside We're gonna have ourselves a little fun Dancin' on the tailgates and raisin' a little cain Rockin' in the pastures and rollin' in the hay It's the life I love And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me I can't get enough of dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things And I take pride in everything I've got 'Cause I'm American-born and country by the grace of God I don't need no Cadillacs you can't put no hay bails in the back It won't cross a creek or tow no heavy load I don't like a high-rise cluttering up my clear blue skies Don't wanna be where the city's all that grows Some are born with a silver spoon and some come from the farm Some have a ball in the mansion but we get down in the barn It's the life I love And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me I can't get enough of dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things And I take pride in everything I've got 'Cause I'm American-born and country by the grace of God We build a world of dreams on a big ol' piece of land We're free to so anything we like we're country so we can It's the life I love And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me I can't get enough of dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things And I take pride in everything I've got 'Cause I'm American-born and country by the grace of God
