   There's a little boy out in the driveway His basketball in hand Saying daddy can we play a little one on one You pat him on the back and say not now son I'm a busy man His sisters out on the sidewalk Setting up a lemonade stand Hey daddy don't you want to buy a glass from me You say maybe later can't you see I'm a busy man You got to go got to run Hit it hard and get it done Everyone can see you're going far You got responsibilities A crazy schedule that you keep And when you say that times a wasting You don't know how right you are Busy man There's a woman in the bedroom crying Saying I thought we had plans You say honey I'm sorry I'll make it up When the job slows down and I'm not such A busy man You got to go got to run Hit it hard and get it done Everyone can see you're going far You got responsibilities A crazy schedule that you keep And when you say that time's a-wasting You don't know how right you are Busy manhave you ever seen a headstone with these words "If only I had spent more time at work There's a call one day from the office They need you down in Birmingham You say no way the weekend's mine I got plans with the kids and a date with my wife I'm a busy man You got to go got to run Take a break and have some fun Those that love you most Say you've come far Got some new priorities In that schedule that you keep And when you say that time's a-wasting Now you know how right you are Busy man
