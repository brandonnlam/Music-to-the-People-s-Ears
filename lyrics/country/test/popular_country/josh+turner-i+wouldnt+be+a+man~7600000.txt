There's a slow moon rising It's shining on your skin The way your body moves me I know there's no holdin' back No holdin' back I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you Was anything I could resist I'd have to be from another planet Where love doesn't exist I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this I can feel passion flowing As you fall into my arms The secret way you touch me Tells me there's no holdin' back No holdin' back I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you Was anything I could resist I'd have to be from another planet Where love doesn't exist I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like Roll with me baby all night long Soul to soul with me baby all night long I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this I wouldn't be a man if a woman like you Was anything I could resist I'd have to be from another planet Where love doesn't exist I wouldn't be a man if I didn't feel like this
