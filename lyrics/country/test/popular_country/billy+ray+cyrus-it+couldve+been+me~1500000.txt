   I hear you just got married Took a month long honeymoon And you were all smiles at the wedding And you cried when you kissed the groom I got no invitation I guess the mailman didn't bring it to me But I see the whole thing in slow motion Every night as I try to sleep My buddy John said you looked real pretty And you acted like you were in love He said the preacher asked for objections And he tought about standing up I told John he must've been crazy 'Cause you were just about to say I do He just gave me a wink and said all he could think Is it could've been me with you It could have been me standing there with you It could have been me and my dreams coming true But those dreams move on if you wait too long It took me till now to see it could have been me I don't guess I ever told you That I went out and bought you a ring I even carried it around in my pocket Waiting to say the right thing I pulled it out the other day But the diamond had lost it's shine Well I know how it feels 'cause my eyes grow dim When I think you could've been mine It could have been me standing there with you It could have been me and my dreams coming true But those dreams move on if you wait too long It took me till now to see it could have been me Oh I called her just in time to be too late You know those dreams move on if you wait too long It took me till now to see it could've been me It could have been me standing there with you It could have been me and my dreams coming true But those dreams move on if you wait too long It took me till now to see it could have been me It could have been me...
