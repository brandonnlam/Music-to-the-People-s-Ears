   I like fast cars and shop dreams chased a lot of crazy things  Left behind my share of broken pieces. This morning I turned 36 and you just remember half of it.  You wonder how you out-lived Hank or Jesus. I put the rage in a river roll in a thunder.  But you kept me from going under when that current got too heavy. I always thought I'd be a heap of metal and a cloud of smoke  Foot stuck to the pedal sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy. Fear I've had none what the hell made you wanna love a man who was gonna die young In the mirror I saw my surprise who knew gray hairs like to hide on a head  Didn't think he'd live past thirty. If I make it thirty more it's the brown  That you'll be looking for as you run your fingers through say slow down honey. I put the rage in a river roll in a thunder.  But you kept me from going under when that current got too heavy. I always thought I'd be a heap of metal and a cloud of smoke  Foot stuck to the pedal sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy. Fear I've had none what the hell  Made you wanna love a man who was gonna die young Call it intuition or call it crazy.  Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies.  But I'd gladly stick around if we're together. So baby when you bow your head tonight  Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind and with you I'd like to live forever.
