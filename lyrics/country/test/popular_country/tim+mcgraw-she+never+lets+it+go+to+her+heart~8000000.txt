   Everywhere I go They're staring at her Every man I know he wants to have her I guess I ought to be a jealous man I look the other way they're hittin' on her Every night and every day they telephone her They try to get to her but I know they can't Chorus She never lets it go to her heart She never lets it go that far When they start talking she starts walking Right back to my arms She can turn every head But she never lets it go to her heart She walks into the room and everybody watches every move Hoping she don't love me I know it by the way they hang around But they don't realize there's more to her than What meets the eye that's why I'm certain No matter what they do to reach her now Repeat Chorus When they start talking she starts walking Right back to my arms She can turn every head But she never lets it go to her heart
