   Fancy cars and diamond rings  I seen all kinds of shiny things  I should be feelin' like a king  But lord I don't. Great big towns so full of users. Make a million still a loser. Some may bet on you to win  Most hope you won't. Livin' wild ain't no mercy being free  When it brings you to your knees. Can't keep lying. I've seen the road now  I know just what I need  To find my way back to Tennessee. I'm going home now  To Southern is so sweet  And find my way back to Tennessee I was only seventeen  I lived behind my beauty queen  I turned my back on everything  And everyone. Rooms with lots of pretty faces  Still don't fill the empty spaces  Wanderin' where Amazing Grace is  There is none no. Now I know there's no comfort in this world. God I miss that hometown girl  Want to hold her. I'm on the road now  I know just what I need  To find my way back to Tennessee. I'm coming home now  To Southern is so sweet  And find my way back to Tennessee All this time I was chasing after dreams  It was right in front of me  I was lost without her. I'm on the road now  I know just what I need  To find my way back to Tennessee. I'm coming home now  To Southern is so sweet  And find my way back to you and me  Find my way back to Tennessee.
