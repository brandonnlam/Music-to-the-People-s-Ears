   Man I hate you found me here With whiskey on my breath I know I should be ashamed So much for those twelve steps He said No my son I know you're doin' your best For all you've been through hey I understand I only came here to be your friend You know she still asks about you And wonders how you're doin' and where you been... Chorus 1: Tell her I'm in Tampa on the causeway Watchin' the waves roll in Tell her I'm in Aspen in a cabin Findin' myself again Tell her that I'm happy  and I've moved on Better than I've ever been Just don't tell her that you saw me drownin' in this bottle Tryin' to make her disappear Tell that I'm anywhere Anywhere but here It would only break her heart If she knew the truth See I told her when she left This was the last thing I would do Tomorrow I swear I'm startin' over again I've made it this far and I know how it ends But she doesn't have to find out where I am So if you see or hear from here again Chorus 2: Tell her I'm in Baton Rouge Louisiana Sellin' cars five das a week Tell her I'm in Mobile Alabama Gettin' back on my feet Tell her I'm happy and I've moved on Lookin' better than you've ever seen Just don't tell her that you saw me drownin' in this bottle Tryin' to make her disappear Tell that I'm anywhere Anywhere but here Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on But let her know that I still care Man tell her I'm anywhere Anywhere but here Tell her I'm anywhere Anywhere but here
