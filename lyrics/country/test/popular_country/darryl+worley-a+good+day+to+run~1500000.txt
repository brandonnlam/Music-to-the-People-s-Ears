   Darryl Worley/Bobby Tomberlin I'm tired of working every day for a dollar About to choke on my own blue collar This ain't gonna last Misled by the grand illusion I've come to this conclusion I can't make a move too fast It was written in the sky today By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run Wide open down a two-lane highway It's about time that some things went my way Throwing troubles out to the wind and I'm praying that they never catch up again I'm gonna say my worrying days are done And this looks like a good day to run My baby's been working as a cashier She didn't get a vacation this past year Now it won't be long We don't need no destination Just a tank of gas and a good clear station Playing our favorite song There're some places that we ain't been Some things we ain't done And it sure looks like a good day to run Wide open down a two-lane highway It's about time that some things went my way Throwing troubles out to the wind and I'm praying that they never catch up again I'm gonna say my worrying days are done And this looks like a good day to run I'm gonna say my worrying days are done And this looks like a good day to run A good day to run A good day to run
