   You've always been a friend of mine And that's the way we'll be 'til the day I die It's good to know you're on my side 'Cause now you know she's leaving me And I need your help to make her see So turn on your charm and let it shine 'Cause you've always been the one Who could make her stay around So when she gets to the city limit sign Don't let me down Oh Laredo don't let her go Just take by the heart And let the wheels turn slow Oh Laredo you're my only hope So get her back to the day we met 'Cause that's as far as she needs to get But please don't let her go Oh Laredo Make her think about the moonlit walks And the long long talks  by the waters edge With her feet hanging off the Cane Creek Bridge And bring to mind the first kiss we shared At the old town square when she drives down there 'Cause that's a day she said she could never forget Keep the nights by the candlelight As an ace in the hole 'Cause those are nights of passion That I know will bring her home Oh Laredo don't let her go Just take by the heart And let the wheels turn slow Oh Laredo you're my only hope So get her back to the day we met 'Cause that's as far as she needs to get But please don't let her go Oh Laredo Oh Laredo don't let her go Just take by the heart And let the wheels turn slow Oh Laredo you're my only hope So get her back to the day we met 'Cause that's as far as she needs to get But please don't let her go Oh Laredo
