It was the 14th of October Had that t-shirt off your shoulder I was drunk said I was sober And you said yeah right We were talkin' for a minute Then some guy tried to cut in You took my hand and we pretended Like I was your guy Oh then I tried to guess your middle name For 30 minutes bet we played that game That mango-rita you were drinkin' And that Coldplay song that you were singin' And I bet right now you're probably thinkin' That it's crazy I remember every detail but I do From your blue jeans to your shoes Girl that night was just like you Unforgettable We were dancin' we were buzzin' Takin' shots like it was nothin' Did the runnin' man you loved it Yeah you laughed out loud You brushed away your blonde hair And you kissed me out of nowhere I can still show you the spot Where everything went down Oh I told you I was gonna marry you You probably didn't think that it was true That mango-rita you were drinkin' And that Coldplay song that you were singin' And I bet right now you're probably thinkin' That it's crazy I remember every detail but I do I can still smell your perfume Girl that night was just like you Unforgettable Oh that night was just like you baby I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin' And it feels just like it was last weekend That we jumped in Right off the deep end That mango-rita you were drinkin' And that Coldplay song that you were singin' And I bet right now you're probably thinkin' That it's crazy I remember every detail but I do I can still smell your perfume Girl that night was just like you Unforgettable From your blue jeans to your shoes Girl that night was just like you Unforgettable
