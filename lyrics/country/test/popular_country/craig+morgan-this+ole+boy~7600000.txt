   Songwriters: Akins Rhett Davidson Dallas Hayslip Ben She got her smile on Dog gone nothin' in the world's wrong We're rollin' down a country road She's my shotgun rider I'm the lucky dog beside her My lips are where her kisses go She loves when we go to the river And get in the water And buddy she's hotter than south Georgia in July Man when I'm with her  I can't get enough of her I gotta kiss her and I gotta hug her And brother she's mine all mine This ole boy got it goin' on Got the good Lord smilin' on me Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine Got me buzzin' like a bee She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder Nobody else gets to hold her But this ole boy We're in my old Ford Oh Lord holes in my floorboard But she don't seem to mind We park in a hayfield Fog up the windshield My kind of killin' time She sweetens my tea and butters my biscuit I am who I am and buddy she gets it I ain't gotta change a thing  I don't know if it could get any better But man if it does then I reckon I better Get to pickin' out a ring This ole boy got it goin' on Got the good Lord smilin' on me Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine Got me buzzin' like a bee She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder Nobody else gets to hold her But this ole boy Yeah this ole boy got it goin' on Got the good Lord smilin' on me Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine Got me buzzin' like a bee She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder Nobody else gets to hold her But this ole boy Yeah this ole boy Nobody but this ole boy This ole boy
