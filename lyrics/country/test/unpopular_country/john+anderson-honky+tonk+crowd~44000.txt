   Hey buddy bring me a beer Somebody's playing my song That's why I like it in here I feel I really belong And the waitresses always treat me right When I get a little too loud I like hangin' around in a honky tonk crowd I like the things that they do And the places they go The way they Boogaloo And do the Cotton-Eyed Joe And the breakfast they eat after closing time Would make their mamas proud I like hangin' around in a honky tonk crowd You can find anything you want In a honky tonk crowd The music really turns me on When it's turned up loud Sometimes it makes you feel so good You wanna jump and shout Hey I sure like hangin' around in a honky tonk crowd Bartender bring me a brew My honey walked through the door In fact you better bring two When we get back off the floor 'Cause the moves my baby's gonna put on me Are more than the law will allow I like hangin' around in a honky tonk crowd You can find anything you want In a honky tonk crowd The music really turns me on When it's turned up loud Sometimes it makes you feel so good You wanna jump and shout I like hangin' around in a honky tonk crowd Yeah I sure like hangin' around the honky tonk crowd
