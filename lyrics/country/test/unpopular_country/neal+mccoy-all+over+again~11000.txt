   Turn down the lights turn up the radio. There's a fire in your eyes an' it's keepin' me warm. An' hold on to me like it was yesterday When we both felt our spirits collide. I remember that moment bein' struck down by lightnin' The first time I saw your face and you smiled. Come an' lay down with me feel the space in between us. Find the magic that keeps love alive. This time can be like the first time: Close your eyes an' soon we'll be there. An' no mind could ever guess what we're feelin'. Turn a spark to a flame make a wish Close your eyes watch it start all over again. Just like the first time that you touched my skin. All over again. I tasted Heaven take me there again.(All over again. Your smile your touch your taste It turns me on and on and on: Then I fall in love with you all over again. Come an' step through the stars let's take a ride through the universe. As long as we're here let's take the whole thing in. What I'm tryin' to say is that you're so beautiful Let me say it all over again. This time This time. Can be like the first time: Close your eyes an' soon we'll be there. An' no mind No mind. Could ever guess what we're feelin'. Turn a spark to a flame make a wish Close your eyes watch it start all over again. Just like the first time that you touched my skin. All over again. I tasted Heaven take me there again.(All over again. Your smile your touch your taste It turns me on and on and on: Then I fall in love with you Then I fall in love with you: I keep fallin' in love with you all over again. All over again yeah
