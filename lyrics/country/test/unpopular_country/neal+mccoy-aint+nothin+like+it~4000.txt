   Good morning honey how'd you sleep You know I slept like a baby with you next to me I got time for coffee then I better go clock in The boys are gonna get on me if I'm late again They'll say the girl keeps you busy walkin' the line I'll say yeah that's right And there ain't nothin like it The way you love me There ain't nothin' like it I've never had a feeling come over me That hit my so hard and tasted so sweet And there ain't nothin' like it No there ain't nothin' like it I had a revelation the first time we kissed There's a heaven on earth and this is it It changed everything I think and I do Now everything revolves around being with you Imagine me at home on Saturday night I say yeah that's right And there aint nothin' like it Ain't nothin' like it My friends say you've got my number You're playin' me like a song I say yeah oh just play on And there ain't nothin like it The way you love me There ain't nothin' like it I've never had a feeling come over me That hit my so hard and tasted so sweet And there ain't nothin' like it No there ain't nothin' like it
