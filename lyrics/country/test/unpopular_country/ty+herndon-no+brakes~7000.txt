   We won't know where we're going til we get there But baby you can dream while I drive Just tell me you'd go with me anywhere Take my hand and we'll wave goodbye Chorus As this engine whines across the danger line Down a road Dare-Devil straight There's no stopping us southbound sun up In love too wild to wait Oh hearts wide open no brakes There's a hunger for you running through me An endless unbeatable thrill And the spirit of life you give to me So restless so reckless and real Repeat Chorus Bridge You feel that lightening and thunder Running through my veins A world of wonder still untamed Repeat Chorus
