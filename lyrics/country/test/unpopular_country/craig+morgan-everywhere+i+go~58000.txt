   Craig Morgan/Maria Cannon Goodman/Gene Ellsworth I walk around the block To try to get you off my mind I turn the corner look who's there Just like I remember pretty as a picture And I was just beginning not to care Standing in the rain I stopped to stare 'Cause everywhere I go you're goin' my way In the dark of night in the light of day I can't run and I can't hide There just ain't no place 'Cause everywhere I go you're goin' my way Sittin' at the table I sense you behind me Even though I know you're not really here Climbin' into bed you slide in beside me I feel my eyes well up in tears Oh I can't make your memory disappear 'Cause everywhere I go you're goin' my way In the dark of night in the light of day I can't run and I can't hide There just ain't no place 'Cause everywhere I go you're goin' my way I can learn to live without you I wouldn't even dream about you If you'd only set me free 'Cause everywhere I go you're goin' my way In the dark of night in the light of day I can't run and I can't hide There just ain't no place 'Cause everywhere I go you're goin' my way Everywhere I go I walk around the block To try to get you off my mind
