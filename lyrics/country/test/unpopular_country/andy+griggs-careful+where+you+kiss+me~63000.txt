   Standin in the mirror Rinsin off my razor Wishin i was still in bed Youre sneakin up behind me With nothin but a towel on Start breathin down my neck If you don't wanna spend the rest of this day Lyin in the dark and drivin ieachother crazy Careful where you kiss me Chorus: I love your sweet good mornin baby hugs But you know how your soft lips tear me up Careful where you kiss me You know every button You know how to push em And which ones urn me on Youre on my sweet spot No baby please don't stop 'cause girl im not that strong I don't know how far you want this to go Ut if you don't want me to lose control Careful where you kiss me Chorus: I love your sweet good morning baby hugs But you know how your soft lips tear me up Careful where you kiss me
