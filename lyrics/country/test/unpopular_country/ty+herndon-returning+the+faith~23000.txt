   I pulled on The highway Another day for the wanderer I knew something Was out there Around the corner from where we were You could have Cut and run Straight back to Tennessee But you stood true A real rock And never doubted me Chorus: I will be there Any time you need me to As much as you believed in me I'm returning the faith to you I'm returning the faith to you You held me With a sure hand You gave love every step of the way If it takes me Forever I'll give back everything that you gave Repeat Chorus Bridge: You saved me now baby I wanna do a little something For you Repeat Chorus
