   She's black smoke forming across the sky I ask for water and she brings me wine she brings me wine She's one part angel the other part sin I say I'm tired and she says let's go again Let's go again Chorus: My kind of my kind of beautiful Lover and friend If I'm dreaming please don't wake me up I wanna see how how the story ends She's a bad moon risin' She's the sunlight through the rain She's the calm before the storm Yeah she's a hurricane A hurricane Oh Sunday morning service with that look in her eye I never heard the preacher's words but I saw the light I saw the light Chorus: My kind of my kind of beautiful Lover and friend If I'm dreaming please don't wake me up I wanna see how how the story ends I wanna see how it ends If I'm dreaming please don't wake me up I wanna see how how the story ends My kind of my kind of beautiful Lover and friend If I'm dreaming please don't wake me up I wanna see how how the story ends
