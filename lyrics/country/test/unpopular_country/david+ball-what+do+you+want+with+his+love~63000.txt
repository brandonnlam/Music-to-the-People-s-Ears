   Don't tell me it's all over Don't break my heart in two Happiness is mine when I'm with you Is it true you've found another Are you leaving me behind What do you want with his love You've already got mine So what do you want with somebody new You've already got a love that's true You're gonna look back and long for the day You'll want the love you threw away You will remember this heart you've broken If you leave me far behind What do you want with his love You've already got mine What do you want with somebody new You've already got a love that's true You're gonna hurt me much more than you know If you really mean to let me go You will remember this heart you've broken If you leave me far behind What do you want with his love You've already got mine What do you want with his love You've already got mine
