   Buddy Cannon I was takin' a walk through a small country city Just seem' what there was to see I sat down to read a historical marker When I felt someone sit down by me He leaned on the tank that was helping his breathing Said it's bad when your body is gone I said this is sure a nice town that you've got here He said yeah but there's no place like home I wish I could see Bakersfield Where the oil wells are pumpin' The oranges are bloomin' And the grapevine winds down from the hill When I close my eyes I can touch the clear skies At the corner where I used to live Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield He said you don't ever know where life's gonna lead you When you go ramblin' off down the track Sometimes I wish I'd never left California Then I couldn't want to go back Recitation: He said You know I used to be a well-known country singer Made my first record back in 1953 At one time Buck Owens was my lead guitar player And ol' Hag once wrote a song about me I wish I could see Bakersfield Where the oil wells are pumpin' The oranges are bloomin' And the grapevine winds down from the hill When I close my eyes I can touch the clear skies At the corner where I used to live Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield
