   Chuck Jones/Tom Shapiro I woke up missin you this mornin After runnin into you last night The way you kiss me like a friend is so heartwarming But baby when we meet again If you really want to be my friend Tell me that you're never ever comin back When you're out on the town stop lookin like that Tear out your telephone jack in case I get the urge to call Got my work cut out to gt you out of my heart Tears to stop a new life to start Put my world against the wall I could use your help I can't do it all Try to make myself believe it's over But I don't believe I'm equal to the task I got a million memories to go And I'm gettin' nowhere Oh and help is hard to find So if you could be so kind Tell me that you're never ever comin back When you're out on the town stop lookin like that Tear out your telephone jack in case I get the urge to call Got my work cut out to gt you out of my heart Tears to stop a new life to start Put my world against the wall I could use your help I can't do it all Got my work cut out to gt you out of my heart Tears to stop a new life to start Put my world against the wall I could use your help I can't do it all
