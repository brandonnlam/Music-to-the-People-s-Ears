   I like my next-door-neighbor We do each other favors sometimes We threw somethin' on the grill Sat around and chilled just the other night And we talk about our lawns and the goin's on In our neighborhood He's a real nice guy...that's all fine and good He ain't my honky tonk friends Nobody really understands me like them I love the songs that they sing I love the drinks that they drink I love the dances they dance They don't make fun of my drawl keep somethin' cold and tall in my hand I ain't gotta pretend they take me just like I am I love my honky tonk friends I like my growin' up buddies we still keep in touch now and then Them folks down at the office really ain't all that stiff I met some real good people underneath the steeple in town I'll still make time for them but as for right now I want my honky tonk friends Well we light each other's smokes and we bend each other's ear And we laugh at each other's stupid jokes and we buy each other beers Then we lose our butts in pool but we win it back in darts And we lend each other shoulders when someone breaks our hearts. I love my honky tonk friends Nobody really understands me like them I ain't gotta pretend they take me just like I am I love my honky tonk friends I ain't gotta pretend they take me just like I am I love my honky tonk friends
