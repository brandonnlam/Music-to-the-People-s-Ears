   Once upon time used to feel so fine I really mean to shine We'd laugh like we were drunk on wine But not anymore  No not anymore No not anymore No not anymore Used to feel so good Used to laugh like we should We did what we could Come on baby I'm sorry Would you open the door  Come on open the door  Come on open the door  Come on open the door   Baby don't say the stars are falling from your eyes Baby just say say you need me one more time For you and I There is no good in goodbye You know I used to love to leave Always had something up my sleeve I guess I mistook being alone for being free But no never again  No never again  No never again  No never again   Yes I too was just like you Finding comfort in a strangers face In some darkened place where no one knew my name And I was slow to see that everything had changed And I was sad to see that I would never be the same But without you by my side I'd go insane You make the world make sense Baby you make the world make sense  For you and I There is no good in goodbye There'll be no goodbye
