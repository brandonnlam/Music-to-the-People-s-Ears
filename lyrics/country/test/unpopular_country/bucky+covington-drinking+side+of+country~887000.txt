   We played down in the Bayou In some old barn they turned into a bar This pretty little red hair girl Took our drummer to her car They were getting hard and heavy When someone hollered mister and said “You ain’t from around here Get your hands off my sister” We roll we roll we roll we roll We roll down on the highway On the drinking side of country That’s the ramblers on the run So we went up to Detroit and took some country to the city Like some old hillbilly tourists I guess we looked real silly Cause they were laughing at us man Till we tired out the band Said you hicks are pretty slick So we jammed and then we split We roll we roll we roll we roll We roll down on the highway On the drinking side of country That’s the ramblers on the run Wooo Oh ya Haha Look what’s coming over this way buddy I’m out here Brunette from Minnesota drinking Jim Bean and Cola kept Buying him round shots She was trying to get me drunk I said my heart don’t belong to me I left it back in Tennessee She said “Your heart ain’t the part that I want We roll we roll we roll we roll We roll down on the highway On the drinking side of country That’s the ramblers on the run We roll we roll we roll we roll We roll down on the highway On the drinking side of country That’s the ramblers on the run Oh no I smell trouble Just a second I’ll be right back
