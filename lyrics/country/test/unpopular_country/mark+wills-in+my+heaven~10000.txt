   Rivers Rutherford/Bobby Pinson In my Heaven there ain't no lawyers Don't need names on dotted lines Folks do buisness like they oughta A good firm handshake works just fine We feed lawyers to the lions In my Heaven there ain't no children Totin' loaded guns to school Ain't no such think as peer pressure Being who you are is cool We still teach that golden rule In my Heaven we hurt no one No lyring crying or dying young No one's lonely no one's scared And everyone is welcome there In my Heaven In my Heaven I can sing like Elvis Play guitar like B.B. King Slide a fastball past Hank Aaron Hey now batter batter swing I can do most anything In my Heaven we hurt no one No lyring crying or dying young No one's lonely no one's scared And everyone is welcome there In my Heaven I know that it's God's decision What my Heaven's gonna be I ain't tellin' him his buisness But if he left it up to me Then in my Heaven There's football with no referees Then in my Heaven There's never been an injury In my Heaven Angels yodel when they sing And in my Heaven The fish will bite most anything In my Heaven In my Heaven
