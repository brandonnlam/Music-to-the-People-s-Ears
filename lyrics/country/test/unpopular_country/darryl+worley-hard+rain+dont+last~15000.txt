   Girl tonight it's pouring down on us It's been building for so long Yeah it's dark I know but don't let go And don't say our love is gone Chorus: If we hold on till the morning I know this storm is bound to pass That ol' sun is gonna shine again tomorrow Hard rain don't last Girl we tore it up made a mess of it Left the pieces on the floor But if we forgive and get through this We'll be stronger than before Chorus Everything's gonna seem brighter when the sky clears We'll still be loving each other after these tears Chorus
