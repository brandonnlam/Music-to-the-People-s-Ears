   Your daddy called you down to the farm Said he needed the crop in the barn yesterday Two days gone six days there all I do is sit and stare at a tv Well I ain't done nothin' yet but baby don't forget how I get when I get lonely Well I ain't strayed a little bit cause baby you're still it but I'm gettin' lonely Your sister kept you busy all last week Movin' her back to Albuquerque New Mexico Your girlfriend called the week before that Said she was sad and didn't want to be all alone Well I ain't done nothin' yet... I painted the house and I painted the town Just keepin' busy till you get back around to lovin' me It's Friday night the phone just rang It's that girl ole what's her name to say she's free Well I ain't done nothin' yet... I'm gettin' lonely don't let me get lonely
