   He grew up in a time When a third-grade education Was all the school you needed To work the family farm. He'd take time off on Sunday Him and all his family Warm a pew And give thanks to the Lord. There was no gray only black and white. Didn't need no-one to tell him What was wrong or right. 'Cause he had God Family and Country. He set aside his plow In early 1940 Said goodbye to his small town And put on the Army green. Hard Times on the front lines Writin' letters on wet paper Not one word about the awful things he'd seen. His was a generation That answered without question. They knew they had to win 'Cause they were fightin' for... God Family and Country. On the coffee table Sits the family Bible Where just last year he added A little boy to the family tree. There's the folded flag they gave us On the day he left us. But the thing that I remember most Is the way that he... Believed... In God Family and Country... Ohhh we've got God... Family... And Country......
