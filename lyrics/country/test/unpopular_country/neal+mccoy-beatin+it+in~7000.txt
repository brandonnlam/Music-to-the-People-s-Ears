   I can make my mind up I can put my foot down Yeah I can stand my ground resolve that I'm not gonna fall I can try to evade it and try to avoid it And tell myself to just ignore it but I know that order's just too tall 'Cause there's the vision of your eyes The linger of your touch it's too much And here it comes like a rolling thunder Like a wall of marching soldiers Oh it just takes me over and I can't fight it no Yeah well it's just your love oh that's a burning in my blood So tell me how on earth can I deny it When my heart keeps beating it into my mind Like the sunrise like the four seasons oh it just keeps repeating Yeah it's a constant in my world So I might as well give and I might as well face it Just open up my arms and embrace it because I know I love you girl 'Cause there's a meaning in my life A connection in our soul here I go And here it comes like a rolling thunder Like a wall of marching soldiers Oh it just takes me over and I can't fight it no Yeah well it's just your love oh that's a burning in my blood So tell me how on earth can I deny it When my heart keeps beating it into my mind Now here it comes like a rolling thunder Like a wall of marching soldiers Oh it just takes me over and I can't fight it no Yeah well it's just your love well it's a burning in my blood So tell me how on earth can I deny it When my heart keeps beating it into my mind Beating it into my mind
