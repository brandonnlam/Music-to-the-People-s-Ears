   V. F. Stewart Love the runs away fro me Dreams that just won't let me be Blues that keep on bothering me Chains that just won't set me free Too far away from you and all your charms Just out of reach of my twp empty arms Each night in dreams I see your face Memories time can not erase Then I awake and find you gone And I'm so blue and all alone So far away from lips so sweet and warm Just out of reach of my two open arms That lonesome feeling all the time Knowing you can not be mine Dreams that haunt me in my sleep Vows that we could never keep Too far away from lips so sweet and warm Just out of reach of my two open arms
