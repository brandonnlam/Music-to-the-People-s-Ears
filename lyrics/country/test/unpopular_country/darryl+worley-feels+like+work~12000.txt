   Darryl Worley/Leslie All day long I break my back To keep this company in the black There's gotta be an end to all this labor When I hear that whistle blow I can't wait to see your smiling face and Lose myself in your embrace But lately every day when I walk in Oh it feels like work again So maybe we should find ourselves a mountain top A little place to stop for awhile Get above the things that made us feel this way Hey a day or two and we'll come back in style Just a little time together Oh it's bound to make things better Till the weight of this old world starts closing in And it feels like work again Now life it ain't no fairy tale And I guess we know all too well How sometimes it can get a little crazy Yeah that's the way it is So we just keep on going But there's peace of mind in knowing We can run off somewhere every now and then When it feels like work again So baby we should find ourselves a mountain top A little place to stop for awhile Get above the things that made us feel this way Hey a day or two and we'll come back in style Just a little time together Oh it's bound to make things better Till the weight of this old world starts closing in And it feels like work again Yeah we just keep on going 'Cause there's peace of mind in knowing We can run off somewhere every now and then When it feels like work again Yeah when it feels like work again
