   One man can't sleep in his penthouse bed Wall Street worries fill his head While another man dreams In his cardboard she'd on Broadway Early morning traffic jam Wake up call for both of them Will work to eat asks easy street for small change And which one needs it more The rich man or the poor A change of heart and attitude Unselfishness meets gratitude Chorus It's enough to put tears in God's eyes Enough to make the angels cry When the power of love lifts someone above The emptiness of their unbearable life It's enough to put tears in God's eyes Late at night a baby cries His mother gives him life then dies With no one even by them to be sad But another woman fills the need It's her heart and his mouth she'll feed When she gives her love to the child she never had Oh which one needs it more It's hard to say for sure When something grows where nothing was As strong as any bond of blood Repeat Chorus Bridge Every minute every day a little miracles done Someone opens up their heart and lets it shine like the sun And just the light of that one Repeat Chorus
