   Come on in close the door Have I seen you here before Well a girl like you can sure light up a room Pardon me do you care If I just pull up a chair There's a thing or two I'd like to say to you There's someone who left me that I've waited for so long But just tonight I realized she's not coming back at all Funny thing how you walked in at just the right time 'cause you're the perfect picture to fit my frame of mind Looking back now I know I should have done this long ago So I came in here to make a brand new start So don't go take your time I've got a whole new state of mind And tonight you look just like a work of art There's someone who left me that I've waited for so long But just tonight I realized she's not coming back at all Funny thing how you walked in at just the tight time 'cause you're the perfect picture to fit my frame of mind
