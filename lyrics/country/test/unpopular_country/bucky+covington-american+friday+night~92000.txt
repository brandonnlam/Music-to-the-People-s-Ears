   Cheers from a high school football game on American Friday Night. A chorus of the Pledge of Allegiance as the Veteran's rewind the fight. The crowd roars and the quarterback scores. The loosing side gets quiet. You can almost hear the heartbeat of an American Friday Night. Hey yeah the girls lookin' pretty Man they're good to go. Boys tryin' to shine like stars on the city. Music on the radio. There ain't no place in the whole wide world that can feel so right. Yeah yeah an American Friday Night. Good old boys laughin' back slappin' on the other side of town. The long week behind 'em couple beauties beside 'em. Yeah there ain't no worries now. They all rock to zztop as the blown subwoofer pounds. Yeah that's how good it sounds. And that's how good it sounds. Hey yeah the girl's lookin' pretty. Man they're good to go. Boys tryin' to shine like stars on the city. Music on the radio. There ain't no place in the whole wide world that can feel so right. Hey yeah an American Friday Night. Yeah Yeah an American Friday Night. You wanna go to the movies Stay at home and order Dominos Flip a coin Baby you choose it. We can't loose 'cause all I know... Hey hey Girl you're lookin' pretty. Man I'm good to go. We're gonna shine like stars on the city. Songs on the radio. Ain't no place in the whole wide world that can feel this right. Yeah yeah an American Friday... Oh yeah it's American Friday... Oh yeah an American Friday Night.
