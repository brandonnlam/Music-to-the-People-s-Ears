   Here you are on the back of my mind again Don't guess it's gonna get any better Is your memory ever gonna end Or does it go on forever I was the one when you left town Said I'd get along somehow Didn't take long to find out That I was wrong Chorus: Look at me now Nothing but a whole lot of time on my hands Look at me now Thought I wouldn't need you now I understand You said I was never gonna learn Look at me now I was so busy looking at for myself I know I must have took you for granted Didn't want to make room for someone else Didn't know love when I had it You were the one who set me free But you can lay the blame on me Come my way and you'll see I have changed
