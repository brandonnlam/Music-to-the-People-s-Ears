   I met you on a Tuesday Trying to shake the Monday blues Somethin' in your smile told me I had nothin' to lose Still hurtin' from a love gone wrong I'd given up til you came along That's when you got a hold on me And showed me what a love can be You took the one out of lonely And put the two back in together With three little words I love you Forever and ever endlessly You can count on me Now my troubles are behind me Ever since I called you mine Oh every day is bright baby Even when the sun don't shine Every dream I was hoping for You gave to me and so much more Baby you're the only one Just take a look at what you've done You took the one out of lonely And put the two back in together With three little words I love you Forever and ever endlessly You can count on me You really got a hold on me You showed me what a love can be You took the one out of lonely And put the two back in together With three little words I love you Forever and ever endlessly You can count on me (One out of lonely You can count on me (Two back in together You can count on me (Three little words I love you (One out of lonely One out of lonely (Two back in together Two two together (Three little words Count on me
