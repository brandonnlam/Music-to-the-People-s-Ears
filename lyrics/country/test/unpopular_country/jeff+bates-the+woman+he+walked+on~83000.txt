   You don't hurt a woman if you're a real man And then turn your back on her tears He left bruises excuses and promsises that were useless Baby that's why I'm here Chorus: 'cause I warship the woman he walked on I'm gonna hold you at night 'till you're satisfied And I'm gonna right all the he did wrong I worship the woman he walked on I won't sleep around While you're sleepin' alone And come home and crawl in our bed He gave up your sweet touch and the way that you make love He must be out of his head Chorus: 'cause I warship the woman he walked on I'm gonna hold you at night 'till you're satisfied And I'm gonna right all the he did wrong I worship the woman he walked on Solo Chorus: 'cause I warship the woman he walked on I'm gonna hold you at night 'till you're satisfied And I'm gonna right all the he did wrong I worship the woman he walked on Yeah I warship the woman he walked on You don't hurt a woman if you're a real man And you don't turn your back on her tears
