   You were sittin on his tailgate She was lovin on his roughneck She was talkin bout runnin away While he was puffin on a cigarette &amp just thinkin How am I gonna say goodbye He said girl you got it good here You don't need to mess with A guy going nowhere She said how's about Texas He got up and shook his head Then said Aint ya been listenin It's never gonna work out And I think it'd be a good time now To let me go You don't need me baby Stop holdin on the way you are Don't you know I'm no good for you And it'll only break your heart If you don't let me go He said other than a dreamer I ain't nothing but a drifter You could do a lot better He leaned over and he kissed her He said you'd got another year of college And a good momma and a daddy And me I got 93 dollars and this old '82 Chevy So let me go You don't need me baby Stop holdin on the way you are Don't you know I'm no good for you And it'll only break your heart If you don't let me go She said nice try But you can't hide behind those shades there on your face See I don't think you're all that tough I just think you're scared of love And I think I won't take up that much space So let me go Take me with ya baby It's so cold outside your arms And we both know that you're not as strong As you think you are So let me go take me with ya baby I'm alone where you are We both know I'm so good for you And it'll only break ya heart Down the road if you don't let me go...  With ya baby Let me go
