   Now when I was a young girl My dad warned me about the opposite s He'd say yeah that's just what you need Some crazy boy with wild ideas You know what always happens next I tried to heed his advice Now I'm thinkin' it sounds kinda nice It's just what I need on a night like this A long walk in the dark someone I can't resist A little rendezvous a little mystery When I look at you I think that's just what I need Now my momma told me in this dog-eat-dog world You gotta work harder than a man She'd say yeah that's just what you need Some romance book Romeo callin' you at work and messin' up your plans Night falls I slow down I start dreamin' of you comin' around It's just what I need on a night like this A long walk in the dark someone I can't resist A little rendezvous a little mystery When I look at you I think that's just what I need Moonlight sweet bliss Melting with every kiss Dancin' real slow When you hold me close I know It's just what I need on a night like this A long walk in the dark someone I can't resist A little rendezvous a little mystery When I look at you I think that's just what I need Just what I need Just what I need Oh yeah
