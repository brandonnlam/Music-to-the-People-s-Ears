   We didn't know for sure but everybody said That ol' boy ain't right in the head he's a little slow We'd hide in the bushes not making a sound When he'd walk by we'd push him down on that dirt road I was just as guilty as my friends We had a lot of laughs at his expense. Chorus: He wasn't like us he wasn't kool. He'd just smile even while we were being cruel. He stood out he didn't fit in  But we kept throwing the stones no we didn't let up on him. He never said a mean word no he never even made a fuss. He wasn't like us. Later on he made a name in our town For hanging out and running around with the rough crowd They were boozers and losers and low class broads But he saw good in 'em nobody else saw &amp he brought it out Then the rumors started flyin' that he was some kind of holy man But we set him straight &amp told him to his face he was a crazy man Repeat Chorus Well I remember the day he got in trouble with the law They cussed him &amp kicked him &amp mocked him &amp whipped him And they nailed him to the cross Repeat Chorus He wasn't like us he didn't fit in And I fell down on my knees &amp wept for him He never said a mean word no he never even made a fuss. He never did nothing wrong all he ever did was love. He wasn't like us. He wasn't like us.
