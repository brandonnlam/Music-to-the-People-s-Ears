   Barry Tolbert Lookout Lane He was white knuckling a diamond ring And fumbling for the dome light Sherry Lynn knows something's up 'Cause Berry ain't ever been stuck For words like he is tonight Since they pulled over her hearts been beatin' faster Without that song who knows he might have never asked her Simple words put into lines Just a melody and rhyme But at that moment seemed so strong How can a piece of poetry Knock a grown man to his knees And lead him by the heart to where he belongs Then it came on The song Larry Pearson had a crutch One more was never enough He'd say I can quit anytime The whole town knew his name They'd all say what a shame He's wastin' away his life A strangers quarter dropped into that corner jukebox It's been almost two years and guess what made him stop Simple words put into lines Just a melody and rhyme But at that moment seemed so strong How can a piece of poetry Knock a grown man to his knees And lead him by the heart to where he belongs Then it came on The song Simple words put into lines Just a melody and rhyme But at that moment seemed so strong How can a piece of poetry Knock a grown man to his knees And lead him by the heart to where he belongs Like the song Its more than just a song
