   When I was smaller wishing I was taller I woke up one morning and my mama was gone I tried to talk to my father he told me not to bother him He said boy being a man means being strong Now leave me alone So you say you wanna see behind the curtain You wanna know why I don't show it when I'm hurting It never did me any good before so long ago I locked that door But please don't think I'm pushing you away It's just the man I am today Before I was loved by you I didn't know how to Love was nothing to me but a four letter word But I'm learning being strong don't mean being alone So just hold on girl and soon you're gonna know The man I'll be tomorrow So you say you wanna see behind the curtain You wanna know why I don't show it when I'm hurting It never did me any good before so long ago I locked that door But please don't think I'm pushing you away It's just the man I am today It never did me any good before so long ago I locked that door But please don't think I'm pushing you away It's just the man I am today The man I am today
