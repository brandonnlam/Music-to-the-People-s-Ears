   Yeah. If you could read my mind you might slap my face. If you could see inside my heart you'd see it's in the right place. See it's like bunnies in a Bramble or honey bees in a hive. Whenever I'm beside you that's my paradise. Might be a twisted way of sayin' I ain't proud an' no offence But I been thinkin' 'bout you baby in the future tense. We'll take it slower than a broke-knee'd turtle. Yeah we'll get tighter than your grandma's girdle. Oh I want you I need you an' I'll never do you wrong. If you're feelin' what I'm singin' baby: sing along. Ain't no moonshine maker ain't no man of the cloth. Ain't no kangaroo lawyer but I will get you off. 'Cause anything worth doin's worth doin' again An' again an' again an' when We're dancin' slower than a broke-knee'd turtle. Gettin' tighter than your grandma's girdle. Oh I want you I need you an' I'll never do you wrong. If you're feelin' what I'm singin' baby: yeah sing along. Yeah. I want you I need you an' I'll never do you wrong. If you're diggin' what I'm singin' baby: just jump on in an' sing along. Slower than a broke-knee'd turtle. Tighter than your grandma's girdle. Don't say a word: Mmm sing like a bird. Don't say a word: Yeah sing like a bird. Slower than a broke-knee'd. Tighter than your grandma's. Yeah. To Fade.
