    Will you still roll your eyes when I tell dirty jokes Will I still hold your hand when we're drivin' down the road Will you still hide a bottle of wine in your purse when we're at the movie Will you still slap my hand away when I try and smack your booty  Hey hey hey hey hey Tell me it'll always be this way You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy We'll still kiss and we might cuss Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80 When we're 80  Will you still rub my feet when I put down the seat Will you still call me honey if we run out of money tomorrow Will we still walk the dogs will I still take you fishin' And dance in the kitchen and listen and sway to Sinatra Fly Me To The Moon baby When we watch The Notebook will we still get sentimental Will I drop you off at the beauty shop in a Lincoln Continental singin'  Hey hey hey hey hey Tell me it'll always be this way You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy We'll still kiss and we might cuss Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80 When we're 80  When we're 80 Won't you grow young with me girl  Hey hey hey hey hey Tell me it'll always be this way You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy We'll still kiss and we might cuss Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80 When we're 80
