   You lay down by my side And I can hear you breathing You don't know that I know You're gonna wait until I fall asleep So I don't have to see  See you walk away Beg you to stay Well baby just lie to me Let's make this easy Let my heart think that you'll come home And you're not gonna leave Lie to me Let my heart believe that you won't stay gone Baby stretch the truth Convince me there's still me and you Maybe he won't notice Maybe he won't care That you're gone Baby just lie to me Let's make this easy Let my heart think that you'll come home And you're not gonna leave Lie to me Now my heart knows From tonight on it'll be alone That you ain't ever comin' back White lie saves a heart attack
