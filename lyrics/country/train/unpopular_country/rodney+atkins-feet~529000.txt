   Don't let the sunset on a argument It's easy to say when your not in one that's a fact. Cause when were not getting along she got a strong stubborn side But I can't call the kettle black. Cause sometimes our silly fights May go well into the night And we hit the sack back to back To ticked off to speak We rather hold our grudges then be the one that budges We go to bed buttin' heads and tuggin' sheets But we never fall asleep without touchin' feet. Yeah we'll take cover on our queen sized battle field Our angry eyes are almost closed We'll swallow just enough of our foolish pride To whisper the truth soul to soul toe to toe. Sometimes our silly fights May go well into the night And we hit the sack back to back To ticked off to speak We rather hold our grudges then be the one that budges We go to bed buttin' heads and tuggin' sheets But we never fall asleep without touchin' feet. It's not given in it's sayin' nobodies leavin' But you know that I still love you even when were disagreeing Cause sometimes our silly fights Go well into the night And we hit the sack back to back To ticked off to speak Cause We rather hold our grudges then be the one that budges Go to bed buttin' heads and tuggin' sheets But we never fall asleep without touchin' feet.
