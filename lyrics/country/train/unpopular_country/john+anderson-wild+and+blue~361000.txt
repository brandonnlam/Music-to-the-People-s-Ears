   Way across town a phone rings off the wall If you know he ain't home why do you keep callin' You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true It's making you wild and blue Wild and blue it's no wonder look at the things that you do They could just take you up to yonder you're already wild and blue In somebody's room on the far side of town With your mind all made up and the shades all pulled down Someone is trying to satisfy you He don't know you're wild and you're blue Wild and blue it's no wonder... It's four in the morning and you're all alone With no place to go why don't you come home I'll be right here baby waitin' for you I know you've been wild and blue Wild and blue it's no wonder... Wild and blue it's no wonder...
