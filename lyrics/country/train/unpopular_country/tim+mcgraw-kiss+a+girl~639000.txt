    So you meet her outside the club And neither one of you is lookin' for love Everybody’s leavin' she gives you her number You think you might call her It’s just another in the long line of lonely hearts  You turn around to say goodbye Everything else you ever felt feels like a lie Then your eyes meet and everything changes You can’t remember your own name  And it’s cherry red sweet boy You don’t know you’re gonna change your world When you kiss a girl  Then it’s roses roller coasters and Panama City A million tan bodies none of them are as pretty Sundresses scattered on the hardwood floor And it’s not your bathroom anymore You think you’re gonna faint at the justice of the peace You wake up next to her the sun rises in the east  And it’s sleepy and warm boy You don’t know you’re gonna change your world When you kiss a girl  She knows what you’re thinkin' before you can think it Says she’s not thirsty when she takes yours and drinks it She’s an angel from heaven stubborn as hell She knows all your secrets but she’ll never tell  A few ups a few downs makeups and fights She wakes you up in the middle of the night She says it’s time you hear that baby cry Then you finally realize the reason why  You kissed some girl Oh you kiss a girl You kissed the girl
