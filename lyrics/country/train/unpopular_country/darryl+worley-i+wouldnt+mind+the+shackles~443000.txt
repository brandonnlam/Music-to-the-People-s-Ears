   Darryl Worley/Howard Perdew I've been known to have a drink or two In the comfort of my home It helps to minimize the crazy things I hear when I'm alone You'd think by now that every sound Wouldn't send her memory crashing through my brain I wouldn't mind the shackles if it wasn't for the rattle of the chain Certain little things she used to say They come through loud and clear It's sad but I admit I listen closer than I did When she was here Now every noise sounds like her voice And I'm torn between the pleasure and the pain I wouldn't mind the shackles if it wasn't for the rattle of the chain I wouldn't mind the shackles I knew the day she left That I'd be wearing them until the end of time But every day's a battle just to keep the burden of my heart From interfering with my mind It's knowing that I'll always have her last goodbye Ringing in my ears driving me insane I wouldn't mind the shackles if it wasn't for the rattle of the chain Now it seems like everytime I turn around here it comes again Someone else is telling me about the brand new love she wound up in I tell myself they all mean well But I still tremble at the mention of her name I wouldn't mind the shackles if it wasn't for the rattle of the chain I wouldn't mind the shackles I knew the day she left That I'd be wearing them until the end of time But every day's a battle just to keep the burden of my heart From interfering with my mind It's knowing that I'll always have her last goodbye Ringing in my ears driving me insane I wouldn't mind the shackles If it wasn't for the rattle of the chain No I wouldn't mind the shackles If it wasn't for the rattle of the chain
