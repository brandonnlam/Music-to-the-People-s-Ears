   Tony Martin/Mark Nesler When she walked out on me you hung around Said you couldn't stand to see me going down And that someday I'd forget all about her in time You were right she's the last thing on my mind Now you say that since I'm feeling strong again You're leaving and you'll always be my friend Thanks to you I know now what love is all about There's just one little thing that you left out Who's gonna get me over you Who'll take your place like you took hers And pull me through You got me over her when she left Just like you said you'd do But tell me who's gonna get me over you You put together all she tore apart But somewhere along the way I lost my heart You had me believing I could make it on my own Right up to the moment you were gone Who's gonna get me over you Who'll take your place like you took hers And pull me through You got me over her when she left Just like you said you'd do But tell me who's gonna get me over you
