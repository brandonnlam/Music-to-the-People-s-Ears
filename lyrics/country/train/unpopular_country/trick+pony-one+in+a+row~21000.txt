   Tonight I'll be drinkin' tequila And toasting to old Mexico Listening to Waylon and Willie And feeding the fire down below It's only been twenty-four hours Since my baby walked out on me If everything's right I will make it tonight 'Cause I've got a sure remedy From sunup to sundown I'll paint this one-horse town I don't give a damn if anyone knows I'll party on till the heartache is gone Tonight makes it one in a row I'm not concerned with tomorrow It's gonna be more of the same Dancin' on top of the tables Till I can't remember her name Hey bartender break out the bottle I don't need no salt or no lime Just keep 'em comin' till my body's numb She's no longer here on my mind From sunup to sundown I'll paint this one-horse town I don't give a damn if anyone knows I'll party on till the heartache is gone Tonight makes it one in a row From sunup to sundown I'll paint this one-horse town I don't give a damn if anyone knows I'll party on till the heartache is gone Tonight makes it one in a row Tonight makes it one in a row Tonight makes it one in a row Tequila
