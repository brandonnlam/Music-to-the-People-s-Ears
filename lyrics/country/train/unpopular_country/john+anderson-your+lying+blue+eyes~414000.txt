   Your lying blue eyes used to charm me Hypnotize me through and through. Like a fool Lord I've been dreamin' Your lying blue eyes just told on you. All those stories I've been hearin' I wouldn't believe that they were true. But just this morning over coffee Your lying blue eyes just told on you. Your lying blue eyes used to charm me Hypnotize me through and through Through and through. Like a fool Lord I've been dreamin' Your lying blue eyes just told on you. For a long time I have loved you And I thought that you loved me too. Now all my questions have been answered Your lying blue eyes just told on you. Your lying blue eyes used to charm me Hypnotize me through and through Through and through. Like a fool Lord I've been dreamin' Your lying blue eyes just told on you. Your lying blue eyes just told on you.
