   What is it about you that drives me crazy What is it about you that drives me wild What is it that gets my heart a racin' Well I've been thinkin' about it And I've finally put my finger on it Chorus It's everything you do like what you do when you're with me It's everything you say and how you say it baby Your kiss your touch the way that you love Guess what I'm tryin' to say It's everything What is is about you that makes me giddy What is it about you that makes me weak What is it that makes me feel to damn silly Make a list well girl I've tried it But there ain't no way to quantify it It's everything you do like what you do when you're with me It's everything you say and how you say it baby Your body your mind the child that's inside Guess what I'm tryin' to say It's everything
