   I've got a feeling coming over me Being here close to you It's a strong feeling like I never had before I'm just a little bit nervoous and don't know what to do It may seem strange but girl I'm wantin' it more South moon under it's a natural wonder It makes lovers fall in love It can make you wanna laugh or cry South moon under it hits you like thunder And girl I've got a feeling There's a south moon under tonight I've heard old folks talk about The moon and stars and signs But I never knew just how true it could be Then just out of nowhere and right before my eyes I saw a light that made a believer out of me South moon under it's a natural wonder It makes lovers fall in love It can make you wanna laugh or cry South moon under it hits you like thunder And girl I've got a feeling There's a south moon under tonight South moon under it's a natural wonder It makes lovers fall in love It can make you wanna laugh or cry South moon under it hits you like thunder And girl I've got a feeling There's a south moon under tonight Yeah girl I've got a feeling There's a south moon under tonight.
