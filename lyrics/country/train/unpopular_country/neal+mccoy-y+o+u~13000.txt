   A light from a star shines down Here in the dark and you're not around A distance so far to travel alone If we could measure what's right from wrong I wonder could we change the past and make it better Then I'd follow that star I've been wishing upon Chorus I say a prayer for you tonight You're here in my heart forever my love I wish for your days all to be bright No stormy weather just blue skies above Girl I'm on your side there'll be no sad goodbyes You'll always be in my life I thought lettin' go wouldn't be hard But how could I know I'd lose my heart How could I see all that you mean to me Now I'm out in the cold and I don't know which way to go I only hope that you're safe and happy somewhere And whatever you do Baby just kow I care Repeat chorus Bridge Maybe dreams can come true Maybe love never dies If we can just forgive If we could only try You'll always be in my life Girl I'm on your side there'll be no sad goodbyes You'll always be in my life You'll always be in my life
