   First time I felt it think I was five years old. I was scared had a nightmare Momma was there for me to hold. Daddy he was different he never said it much But I heard him loud and clear when he brought home that ball and glove. Then it took on a brand new meaning I wasn't just a boy no more when she moved in next door. Where you from What's your name Wanna go to my game Got the keys to my Dad's old truck. Turn the radio off to remember the song We held hands and there we was Love. Pages kept on turnin' there I was with someone else. First time in my lifetime I wasn't livin' for myself. I knew I wasn't fallin' anywhere I'd fell before. This place was different: it was deeper it was more. Then it took on a brand new meaning Yeah it was strong and it was true knew what I had to do. Found a ring hit my knees Couldn't talk couldn't breathe My heart had me all choked up. Said: I do as we cried wedding bells Waved goodbye the whole church knew it was: Love. Then it took on a brand new meaning When the doctor said: It's time to watch your miracle arrive. Thank the Lord cut the cord. Take her home help her grow. And complete the circle of love. Love. That's the circle of love. To fade out.
