   Ain't it something You can jump on a plane And hop on a bus catch you a train Take in a Saturday game at Wrigley Field Man ain't it awesome You can hit Talladega Drink you a beer with the fan of the driver You've always hated and probably always will Yeah I forget how good I got it sometimes How lucky I am just to be alive Oh I pass through a prayer to the man upstairs Just to thank Him like I should Let Him know I get it I got it good Oh it's amazing that boy in the yard Is half of my wife and God bless his heart The other half is every last bit of me I can't explain it how his mama wound up with somebody like me When she could've done so much better Make you fall down on your knees Yeah I forget how good I got it sometimes How lucky I am just to be alive Oh I pass through a prayer to the man upstairs Just to thank Him like I should Let Him know I get it I got it good yes I do I get going so fast that what matters gets blurred And I can't feel the grass see the trees hear the birds The sky starts to rain and I cuss and complain like a fool Yeah I forget how good I got it sometimes How lucky I am just to be alive Oh I pass through a prayer to the man upstairs Just to thank Him like I should Let Him know I get it God I got it good yes I do Get it got it good yes I got it good
