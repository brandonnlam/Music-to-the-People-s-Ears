   Writers: Doug Supernaw/Kenny King I just called to say hello I hope everything's alright Me I'm doin' fine but I still can't sleep at night I finally had a good day just last week At least the best one since you've gone But it kills me when I hear When's Mamma comin' home Chorus: And I know that there are somethings You feel that you've been missing I tried to be your Superman I've done all I can Still you feel the need to spread your wings But darlin' if you're listening When the world ain't all you thought it would be You still got me I live everyday a lie and tell the kids that it's alright And I see a lot of you in them when I tuck'em in at night Try hard not to be too weak for one of us must be strong And it kills me when I'm there lyin' all alone
