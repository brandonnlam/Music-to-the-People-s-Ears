   My love goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on There's only so many stars in the night That can make up a milky way And there ain't more than twenty four long hours in a day But they say everything has a limit That ain't exactly true 'Cause there ain't a limit to the love in my heart Or the way that I feel about you Even when the pyramids are gone My love goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on Well I got two hundred thousand miles On a rusty old beat up truck And I hate to say but there's gonna come a day When I'm gonna have to give her up But darlin' since I met you Well here is how it is I could live with losing everything But I would die without your kiss So if you think this fire we lit inside Will burn out you're wrong My love goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on I know that we can't spend Every waking hour together But I can hold you tonight And love you forever Every time I think of what we've got All I do is smile 'Cause the beginning to the end of time Compared to this is a little while I've heard raindrops'll turn into oceans And oceans'll turn to dust But there ain't a single force in the world that'll have an effect on us It may be that the rugged Rocky Mountains don't last long But my love goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
