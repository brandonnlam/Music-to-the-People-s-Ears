   He used to play in daddy's uniform With the stripes across the sleeve And he knew when he was all grown up What he was gonna to be He used to like to ambush every careless cat or dog That had the nerve to cross the battle lines he had drawn And even though he didn't know What his dad was fighting for He was proud to be the other little soldier In this war The phone rang in the middle of the night When they called his dad to go Kissed him and his mom goodbye And said God I love you both I know that it's a lot to ask of such a little man But hold the fort and I'll be home as quickly as I can And even though he didn't know What his dad was fighting for He was proud to be the other little soldier In this war A wall cannot begin to hold The names of all the kids Who gave the great sacrifice That any child could give It was the first time he had ever seen A flag from up that close And he watched them as They folded it so careful and so slow As they gave it to his mother He knew what he should do He raised his little hand and Gave his dad one last solute And even though he didn't know What his dad was fighting for He was proud to be the other little soldier He was proud to be the other little soldier In this war
