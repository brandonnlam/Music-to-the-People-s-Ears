   I woke up the same way this morning Like a stranger in my own life Tired and confused with too much to do Nothing left for my kids and my wife Oh I clung to that first cup of coffee Praying 'God won't you show me what's real?' Then out in the distance I saw through the window A man on a tractor with a dog in a field The dog walked just like it was smiling The man drove like the world was all right The tractor hummed on like a part of a song That you sing to your children at night His work was laid out there before him In rows of green his whole life was revealed Oh what I wouldn't give if I could just live Like a man on a tractor with a dog in a field Let me do what I'm doing Let me be where I am Let me find peace of mind On my own piece of land When I'm lost help me to let go And find someway to feel Like a man on a tractor with a dog in a field There I was watching and wondering My wife came down and sat beside me She said 'it's not about living another man's life It's about seeing your own differently.' Oh this home that I love and my children What more could one man hope to yield Then she touched my face And said 'there's more than one way To be a man on a tractor with a dog in a field.'
