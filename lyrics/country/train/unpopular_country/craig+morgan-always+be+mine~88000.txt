   Oh the first time that we ever danced together You kissed me and I froze right where I stood It felt just like that night could go on forever That's the very moment my heart thought you would Always  Be Always Be Mine Always  Be Always Be Mine Remember when we drove all night down to Daytona I don't even think we ever saw the beach We spent half our weeks vacation  in a hotel room And that might not be your favorite memory But it will Always  Be Always Be Mine Always  Be Always Be Mine Oh I know we said we don't belong  together But if by chance you ever change your mind And you need two arms still dying to hold you It will always Be Always Be Mine I still keep your picture hanging in the hallway And all the letters in the bottom of the drawer I still believe for every one there's only one true love And I realize that I'll never be yours But you'll Always  Be Always Be Mine Always  Be Always Be Mine Yes you'll Always  Be Always Be Mine Always  Be Always Be Mine
