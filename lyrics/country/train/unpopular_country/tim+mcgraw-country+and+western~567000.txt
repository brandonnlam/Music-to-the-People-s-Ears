    We are the black haired girls With the streaks of red And 10,000 sky-blue seats In an open air shed Hearin' that thunder bass drum kick As the amplifiers scream We are the neon midnight riders On a field of broken dreams  Long as the good lords willin’ and the creek don’t rise Beer needs chillin’ and the baby cries Hearts get shot by Cupid’s arrow The road to heaven is straight and narrow  Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor And love still hides behind closed doors Steel guitars keeps on ringin’ Waylon and Willie keep on singin’ If you can swing it if you can sway it You can bet we’ll keep on playin’ Long as the wheel in the sky still turns We are country and western Country and western  The sundress girls in the cowboy boots The Wall Street guy with that Neil McCoy tattoo The backroad Buck and Merle traditionalists Whole lotta love and never been kissed The storytellers city dwellers Four on the floor with fine wine cellars Spreadin' those blankets on the lawn With a bucket of suds singin’  Long as the good lords willin’ and the creek don’t rise Beer needs chillin’ and the baby cries Hearts get shot by cupid’s arrow The road to heaven is straight and narrow  Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor And love still hides behind closed doors Steel guitars keeps on ringin’ Waylon and Willie keep on singin’ If you can swing it if you can sway it You can bet we’ll keep on playin’ Long as the wheel in the sky still turns We are country and western We’re all country and western  We’re northern and southern Sisters and brothers Motor City down to Mississippi Vegas lights to Atlantic City yeah  Long as there’s sawdust on that old dance floor And love still hides behind closed doors Steel guitars keeps on ringin’ Waylon and Willie keep on singin’ If you can swing it if you can sway it You can bet we’ll keep on playin’ Long as the wheel in the sky still turns We are country and western  Fiddle and strings in the boombox beat We’re all country and western Hip-hop flat tops and flip-flop feet We’re all country and western Two lane roads to the city streets We’re all country and western Makin’ the bitter baby just a little more sweet We are country and western
