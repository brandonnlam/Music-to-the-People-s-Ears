   I'm not the kind that gets around Just another face in this little town An everyday man trying to live life right You wouldn't know it to look at me I live in silent misery or I lead a double life I've battled with the bottle All alone for years I've lied a thousand lies And I've cried a million tears I'm too tired to fight it Too ashamed to pray And I'm sure the Lord must be bored With the promises I've made So I sit here with my secret Where no on else can see I'll just keep it Between the devil and me Monday morning here I am Hiding bottles in the garbage can I take out the trash and pray no one sees I keep my family in the dark Lord knows it would break their hearts To see their rock be so weak I've had a good old Baptist raisin' So I've got no good excuse I wish that I was stronger But here's the honest truth I'm too tired to fight it Too ashamed to pray And I'm sure the Lord must be bored With the promises I've made So I sit here with my secret Where no on else can see I'll just keep it Between the devil and me I'm hoping for a miracle I know that I can change No I'm not giving up I know there'll come a day When I'm not too tired to fight it Or too ashamed to pray And I know the Lord won't be bored With the promises I've made I won't live here with my secret Where no one else can see No I won't keep it Between the devil and me No I won't keep it Between the devil and me
