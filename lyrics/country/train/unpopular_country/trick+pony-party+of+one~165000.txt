   Hey Babe Remember all of those nights When you told me that you had to work late Think back To the times you stood me up And the countless broken dates I got tired of the aggravation So I made a reservation A special evening I planned just for you Party of one at a table for two Waitin' on me like I waited on you I can just see you now I can picture your face Checkin' your watch Feelin' so out of place Now you're gonna find out how it feels To be so lonesome and blue Bein' a party of one at a table for two Hey babe By now you must be wonderin' What the heck is taken' so long You think I'm probably stuck in traffic But boy you couldn't be more wrong I call and tell you that I'll be later I left a message with your waiter Says I hope you enjoy your night alone bein'... Party of one at a table for two Waitin' on me like I waited on you I can just see you now I can picture your face Checkin' your watch Feelin' so out of place Now you're gonna find out how it feels To be so lonesome and blue Bein' a party of one at a table for two Thought maybe messin' with your mind Might teach you a lesson this time Surely you're smart enough to know You always reap what you sow Party of one at a table for two Waitin' on me like I waited on you I can just see you now I can picture your face Checkin' your watch Feelin' so out of place Now you're gonna find out how it feels To be so lonesome and blue Bein' a party of one at a table for two
