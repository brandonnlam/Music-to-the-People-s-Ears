   Brown paper sack wintergreen pack A full tank of gas from a mini mart Cruisin' slow with Curtis Loew Speakers 'Bout to blow let the party start Take that ol' dirt road past that grain silo Red taillights glow it's a pickup parade Over the cattle guard find a place to park Show me to the bar take my keys away It's time to play Then it's beer bong hangin' from the hayloft Jell-O shooters with Smirnoff Long necks chillin' in the feed trough Pig smokin' slow Flatbed band cranked up loud The more we drink the better they sound See the bonfire from all around Lettin' everybody know We've gotta barn burner Mini skirts skintight shirts Look so good it hurts drives me insane Mechanical buckin' bull Shot glasses full of tomorrow's pain Ain't you glad you came Drinkin' games goin' in the horse stalls Two step under the disco ball Billy Bob's blowin' on his duck call It's a hell of a show Sticky from the sweat so to beat the heat We go skinny dippin' down in the creek Promise the girls we can't see Thank God for that moon glow We've gotta barn burner Homemade shine way too strong David Allen Coe sing-a-long songs Bathroom lines takin' too long Go behind the tree Party all night 'til the sun comes up Sleep it off 'til you lose your buzz Good luck tryin' to find your truck We'll see you all next week At the Barn Burner Let it burn
