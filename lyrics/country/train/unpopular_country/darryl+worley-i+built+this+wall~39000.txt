   Darryl Worley/Jerry Salley I dug this hole I'm standing in She made it clear she ain't coming back again I'm dying here it's dark and cold Oh I'm the only one to blame I dug this hole I made this bed I'm crying on Just like the heart I broke in two it's hard as stone You can't go back once love is dead Look at me now I dug this hole I made this bed These guilty arms are empty now They were holding someone else When they let her down I lost it all my dreams and plans See what a fool can do with just two hands I built this wall I can't get past It only took one night but Lord it's built to last It's a heartache wide stands treetop tall I dug this hole I made this bed I built this wall These guilty arms are empty now They were holding someone else When they let her down I lost it all my dreams and plans See what a fool can do with just two hands I built this wall I can't get past It only took one night but Lord it's built to last It's a heartache wide stands treetop tall I dug this hole I made this bed I built this wall I dug this hole I made this bed I built this wall
