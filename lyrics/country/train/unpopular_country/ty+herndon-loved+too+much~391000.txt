   You Say You Love Me A Little You Say You Want To Stay Friends You Say You Don't Want No Strings Attached No One On You To Depend You See Love As A Prison I See Love As A Key You Think A Little Is More Than Enough It's Not That Way For Me Chorus I Need To Be Loved Too Much I Need To Be Held Too Tight I Need To Hearsomeone Say At The End Of The Day I'll Make Everything Right When The Rest Of The World Goes Home I Need To Feel Someone's Touch I've Been Alone Too Long Now I Need To Be Loved Too Much Too Much Sun Will Burn You Too Much Rain You'll Drown Too Much Cold Will Freeze You Too Much Wind Will Blow You Down But Love Is Something Different That Disregards The Rules You Call Me A Dreamer But Sometimes Dreams Come True Chorus I Need To Be Loved Too Much I Need To Be Held Too Tight I Need To Hear Someone Say At The End Of The Day I'll Make Everything Right When The Rest Of The World Goes Home I Need To Feel Someone's Touch I've Been Alone Too Long Now I Need To Be Loved Too Much
