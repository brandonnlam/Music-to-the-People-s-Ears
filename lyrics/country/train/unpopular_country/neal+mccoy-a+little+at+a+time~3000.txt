   Sometimes love just fails without a reason That sparkle in her eyes just isn't there The writings on the wall and her silence tells it all She's not in love but that don't mean she doesn't cares So she's leaving me a little at a time She's still here in body But I'm afraid she's made up her mind She's tryin' to be true to her heart And somehow go without breaking mine So she's leaving me a little at a time There's times I wished she come right out and say That once or twice I think she's even tried She wonders if I know and could I survive the blow She's not sure just how to say goodbye So she's leaving me a little at a time She's still here in body But I'm afraid she's made up her mind She's tryin' to be true to her heart And somehow go without breaking mine So she's leaving me a little at a time She's tryin' to be true to her heart And somehow go without breaking mine Oh she's leaving me a little at a time
