   Darryl Worley/Steve Leslie/Randy Hardison There's a little shack tucked back in the timber It wasn't much back then but it was home Sometimes it hurts me to remember Just how long I've been gone Oh how I miss the smell of mama's kitchen And the way she used to sing those gospel songs Right now I wish that me and dad were fishin' So I could tell him he was right and I was wrong Big city nights and lights surround me Feels like a prison to my soul I can hear a whippoorwill calling me home Back where I belong Now all the rockin' chairs are empty I hate to think how tall the weeds have grown I'd give back everything the good Lord gave me If I could just go back to where I belong Big city nights and lights surround me Feels like a prison to my soul I can hear a whippoorwill calling me home Back where I belong Back where I belong
