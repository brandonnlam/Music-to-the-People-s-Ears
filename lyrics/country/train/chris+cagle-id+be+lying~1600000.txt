    If I told you that I was wrong And wanted you to come back home I'd be lying. And if I said that we could work it out And you shouldn't have any doubts I'd be lying. And if I got down on my knees In front of God above And swore before the angels I'd give you my love. And if I told you that I loved you And I put no one else above you I'd be lying. And if I said you're the one for me And I never set you free I'd be lying. And if I somehow found the strength To knock on your front door And tell you face to face I won't hurt you anymore.
