   Mark Nessler/Tom Shapiro/Tony Martin I miss the look of surrender in your eyes The way your soft brown hair would fall I miss the power of your kiss when we made love But baby most of all I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again And let the light back in I miss my friend I miss the colors that you brought into my life Your golden smile those blue-green eyes I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now Saying it'll be alright I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again And let the light back in I miss my friend I miss those times I miss those nights I even miss the silly fights The making up The morning talks And those late afternoon walks I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again And let the light back in I miss my friend...
