   Have you ever wondered what life would be like If you'd only went left instead of taking that right If you had waited just ten more minutes to leave the house Would it all be different Every decision everything we choose has a consequence whether we win or lose Nobody knows that any better than me I left her standing at the station with a ticket and a dream She's the train that I didn't take The big commitment I just couldn't make For fear of breaking my heart I didn't risk the ride She's the lesson I learned the hard way Now being lonely is the price I pay The river of regret runs deep and wide Here on the safe side I still remember the night she left She said she didn't want to lose me but she had to find herself I could've stopped her or got on board with her But now it's too late to reconsider She's the train that I didn't take The big commitment I just couldn't make For fear of breaking my heart I didn't risk the ride She's the lesson I learned the hard way Now being lonely is the price I pay The river of regret runs deep and wide Here on the safe side Sometimes the greatest risk of all Is never taking one at all She's the train that I didn't take The big commitment I just couldn't make For fear of breaking my heart I didn't risk the ride She's the lesson I learned the hard way Now being lonely is the price I pay The river of regret runs deep and wide Here on the safe side Oh I don't want to be alone Here on the safe side
