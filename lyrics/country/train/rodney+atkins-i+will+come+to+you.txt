   I never thought I'd live to see you leave me But just like the rainfall it's coming down And something says I shouldn't try to stop Even though I want to I just don't know how I guess the price of your plans is worth cashing in All our yesterdays but baby someday I will come to you like the sweetest revelation Like the words that you're not saying Or a name you forgot you knew I will come to you Maybe in song you'll see me and realize you need me And baby when you do I will come to you Remember when we went from second guessers To midnight confessors we had no fear How it finally felt to have someone to run to Somewhere to come to baby I'm still there I know you'll find your way back to this place If you follow your heart then stay where you are I will come to you like the sweetest revelation Like the words that you're not saying Or a name you forgot you knew I will come to you Maybe in song you'll see me and realize you need me And baby when you do I will come to you I will come to you like the sweetest revelation Like the words that you're not saying Or a name you forgot you knew I will come to you Maybe in song you'll see me and realize you need me And baby when you do I will come to you
