   Written by Rodney Atkins Dave Berg Annie Tate Sam Tate Old gray fence tarchip road Martin's creek almost home Whitetail buck by a one lane bridge Around the bend up on the ridge There's Thompson's barn leaning just a little Miss Myra's store smell the barbecue Make you stop for gas when you don't need to At least 20 miles to the nearest town Hills and hollers all around And that's me right there in the middle Chorus In the middle of what matters most Father's son's and the holy ghost Open hearts and unlocked doors A way of life worth dying fighting for If you wonderin' where I'll be Take out a map of Tennessee And you'll find me than right there in the middle Rick of wood stacked by the porch Black lab pup scratching at the door Two little boys sayin' daddy's back Next thing I know it's a wrestling match And that's me yeah that's me Repeat chorus In middle of nowhere no where I'd rather be The good lord up above and his earth beneath my feet Repeat chorus
