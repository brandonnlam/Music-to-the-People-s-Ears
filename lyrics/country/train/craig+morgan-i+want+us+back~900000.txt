   Lately I've been lonely Lord knows I don't like that feeling Anymore than you like feeling lonely too I don't know which one's to blame For almost putting out our flame But for me it's not the thing for us to do The way it was the way we were Baby you and me is where it was at And I want I want us back Girl we've come too far For us to give up on tomorrow Where we've shared so many good time yesterdays If I know you like I think I do I know that you don't want to lose The me and you I'm dying to save The way it was the way we were Baby you and me is where it was at And I want I want us back I want to feel your love all over me Wrapped up in us is where I want to be I want I want I want to feel your love all over me Wrapped up in us is where I want to be I want I want us back Lately I've been lonely Lord knows I don't like that feeling Anymore than you like feeling lonely too
