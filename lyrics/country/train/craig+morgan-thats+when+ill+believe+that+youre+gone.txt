   That's When I'll Believe You're Gone Written by Craig Morgan and Craig Morris I still get up an' make enough coffee for two. An' every day when I pray I still thank God for you. Even though my friends all tell me that you're long gone I'm gonna keep hangin' on to you. When my heart ain't hurtin' When I've got you off my mind. When I know that I can make it Through one day without tryin'. When I convince myself that I am really all alone: Baby that's when I'll believe that you're gone. Here I am makin' plans for forever: Me and you what to do: we've done everything together. My imagination's workin' overtime: The pain has made me blind to the truth. When my heart ain't hurtin' When I've got you off my mind. When I know that I can make it Through one day without tryin'. When I convince myself that I am really all alone: Baby that's when I'll believe that you're gone. On my own terms On my own terms. In my own time Soon enough I'll admit You're no longer mine. When my heart ain't hurtin' When I've got you off my mind. When I know that I can make it Through one day without cryin'. When I convince myself that I am really all alone: Baby that's when I'll believe that you're gone. Baby that's when I'll believe that you're gone: You're gone.
