   Now girl you know I'm a rebel I fly by the seat  I ain't into lookin' too far down the street I ain't never had no schedule hangin' on my fridge But if I did baby it would look like this: I said eat sleep love you repeat A little drinkin' in the mix and I'll be like sweet If it's alright with you all I wanna do Is eat sleep love you repeat I might gig a big ole frog on a lazy summer night Squeeze in some work when the piggy bank gets light Catch a little football pick a little six string Long as it don't throw no wrench in my routine I said eat sleep love you repeat A little drinkin' in the mix and I'll be like sweet If it's alright with you all I wanna do Is eat sleep love you repeat A little quesa to the dilla A nap in a hammock every now and then A little worm in my tequila A little you on my lips let's do it again I said eat sleep love you repeat A little drinkin' in the mix and I'll be like sweet If it's alright with you all I wanna do Is eat sleep love you repeat I said eat sleep love you repeat That's what I'm talkin' about I said eat sleep love you repeat I said eat sleep love you repeat
