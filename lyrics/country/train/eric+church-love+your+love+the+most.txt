   I love sleeping in on Saturdays And I love college football games I love not acting my age And good barbeque Yeah I'm a fan of all the books And anything my mama cooks Smallmouth bass have got me hooked On Sunday afternoon Yes I love good cold beer And mustard on my fries I love a good loud honky tonk That rocks on Friday night And hell yes I love my truck But I want you to know Honey I love your love the most Man I love how Redman tastes And damn I love my Nascar race Any song sung by George Strait Is country at it's best Yes I love good cold beer And mustard on my fries I love a good loud honky tonk That rocks on Friday nights And hell yes I love my truck But I want you to know Honey I love your love the most I love Yeah I love scuffed up cowboy boots And broken tore up jeans A four wheel drive eight point bucks And rocky road ice cream And hell yes I love my dog And Jack D in my coke But honey I love your love Yeah I love your love I love your love the most I love your love the most
