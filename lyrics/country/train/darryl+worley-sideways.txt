   Darryl Worley/J.B. Rudd/Vip Vipperman I show up for work on time at least five days a week Punch that clock and toe the line just to make ends meet Every day on my way home I pass them neon lights But I been thinking all day long about stopping in tonight I might get a little sideways Like I did in the old days Every once in awhile you know I slip off the straight and narrow Sitting down on a barstool Cutting up like a dang fool Now and then on Fridays I might get a little sideways I'm gonna call my baby up when that quitting whistle blows Girl put on your dancing shoes and grab my party clothes Meet me down at the rendezvous on highway seventeen We'll stoke up that jukebox and let off a little steam We might get a little sideways Like we did in the old days Every once in awhile you know We slip off the straight and narrow Sitting down on a barstool Cutting up like a dang fool Now and then on Fridays We might get a little sideways
