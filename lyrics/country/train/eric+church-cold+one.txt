   It was a perfect day for the end of May they say a record high I stared at that green water when out of the blue out of surprise She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice She grabbed a beer said I'm out of here and walked out of my life That was a cold one I never will get back Yeah she had to leave did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack She left me hanging high and dry in that hell high summer sun Damn babe that was a cold one It ain't the first time or last time I watched love walk out But it's damn sure the one time I still ain't forgot about I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do Cause every time I see one sweating man I break out in one too That was a cold one I never will get back Yeah she had to leave did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack She left me hanging high and dry in that hell high summer sun Damn babe that was a cold one
