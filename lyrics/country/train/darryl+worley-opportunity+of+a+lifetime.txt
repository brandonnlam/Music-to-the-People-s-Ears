   Darryl Worley/Randy Hardison/Wynn Varble Big brown eyes soft red lips I'm thinkin' I could get used to this This could be the opportunity of a lifetime My heart melts when you whisper my name I've got a feeling if you're feeling the same This could be the opportunity of a lifetime I don't need to travel the world Chase after rainbows I'm telling you girl There's so many things that I'd rather do Like wakin' up each morning with you We've got a chance at a real true love We'd have to be crazy to pass it up This could be the opportunity of a lifetime I can just see us sittin' there Front porch swing with gray in our hair I know it seems like a lifetime away But we could get started today We've got a chance at a real true love We'd have to be crazy to pass it up This could be the opportunity of a lifetime Oh yes-sir-ee this could be The opportunity of a lifetime
