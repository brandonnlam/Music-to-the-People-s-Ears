   Bouw bouw bouw bouw-owh. Bouw bouw bouw bouw bouw-owh Like a honey bee beatin' on my screen door  I got a little buzz and my head is sore. From my bed I can feel the sun Lord I hear the mornin' come. Just a creepin' creepin'. Creepin' creepin' You shot out of hell like a bullet from a gun  A flip up switch a thief on the run. Since the day you left me baby I can feel the lonely  I can hear the crazy just a creepin' creepin'. Just a creepin' creepin' Head for the future run from the past  Hide from the mirror and live in a glass. What dreams forget the whiskey remembers. Kinda like molasses in late December just a creepin' Creepin' oh creep.  Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love  Got under my skin and into my blood. That need ya back comes over me  Like ivy crawlin' up a hickory tree just a creepin' Creepin' just a creep creep creepin' Head for the future run from the past  Hide from the mirror and live in a glass. What dreams forget the whiskey remembers. Kinda like molasses in late December just a creepin' Creepin' ah come on Break it down down down down down down down down down down...  Just last night I saw the light At the end of that tunnel on the other side. Thought I found my way outta this pain Only to find your memory train...  Creepin'. Creepin' creepin' creepin' creepin' creepin' creepin'  Creepin' creepin' Creepin' yeah creepin' yeah creep. Bouw bouw bouw bouw-owh. Bouw bouw bouw bouw bouw-owh
