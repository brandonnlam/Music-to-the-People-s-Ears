   I got a place that I like to slip off to When everything starts closin' in And I got some ways that the world don't agree with Yeah some folks would call it a sin But I work like a dog and I'm good at my job And I live for a one-day weekend So I'm takin' off and I might stay a week Hell I may never come back again I need a breather a sweet senorita Writin' my name in the sand I need a break from this job and this angry boss man Some coconut lotion a chair by the ocean Just sit back and take it all in I got the fever and I need a breather again The people at work they think I'm a loner But I need some time to myself And I don't want to waste my precious vacation Livin' for somebody else 'cause I'll have a drink and I might fall down And I don't think that they'd understand I know it all sounds a little bit crazy Well maybe that's just what I am I need a breather a sweet senorita Writin' my name in the sand I need a break from this job and this angry boss man Some coconut lotion a chair by the ocean Just sit back and take it all in I got the fever and I need a breather again Things fell apart down at the office And I'm getting blamed for it all I've only been back for a couple of days And I'm already climbin' the wall Hey I need a breather a stiff margarita Bring'em as fast as you can 'cause I need a break from this job and this angry boss man Some coconut lotion a chair by the ocean Just kick back and take it all in Yeah I got the fever I need a breather again I got the fever and I need a breather again Yes I do
