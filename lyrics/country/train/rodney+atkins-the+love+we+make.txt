   I'm not the man you see in all those movies Or read about in all those fashion magazines I won't build you monuments Or fill your purse with rubies Baby that's not me But I will hold you while you're sleeping And I will be there when you wake And we can fill up the whole world With all the love we make I may never be a man of great position Never be a new aged sensitive guy But I will hear you every time you shisper I'll feel it when you cry And I will hold you while you're sleeping And I will be there when you wake And we can fill the seven seas With all the love we make Till the last day of forever I know we'll be joined together And I will stand by you I'll be loving you And I will hold you while you're sleeping And I will be there when you wake And we can fill up the whole world With all the love we make All the love we make baby All the love we make
