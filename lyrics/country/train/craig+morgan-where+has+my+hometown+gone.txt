   Barely 18 thought I knew it all My little hometown was way too small For the big dreams I'd been dreaming I thought the fast lane and bright lights was what I was needin' A few long years have come and gone I finally saved enough to get back home To the hills the creeks and timbers Where's that slow paced laid back place I remember Chorus: Tell me where has my hometown gone Lord this looks nothing like the place that I come from What happened to the down home road that I was raised up on Tell me where has my hometown gone There's a mini mall where I used to hunt squirrels Time's made momma's out of the girls I used to chase when I was younger They say old Mayor Baker is six feet under Riverview Drive is up to four lanes No whistle blows from that midnight train that used to haul out of Southfield Mines Yeah that quiet little place is just a memory of mine
