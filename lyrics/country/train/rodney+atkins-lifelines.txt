   I packed up my pick-up at 17 With uncle Bob's old Martin guitar and a dream Went from singin' in church To singin' for tips in a honky tonk Till I became a jukebox flash Play anything from Zeppelin to Cash As a hard headed hard livin' Cover singin' cover of my own self Forgot who I was and where I was from Then early one morning my daddy showed up Lifelines Where would we be without lifelines When we're lost at sea The devil's got you thinking That the boat ain't sinking But you're boots are getting wet That's the thing about lifelines They tell you the truth When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime Thank God for lifelines These days I come home Every Sunday afternoon Mama always says I was just thinking about you How's my favorite son "Say you mean your only one Oh I'm good almost as good as your gravy She said Your sister stops by with her kids everyday But the horse has been tough They're gonna be OK Your daddy keeps them busy watching Barbers on the Water Let some castor cares away She said Son I know you gotta make money But don't forget to make time To slow down and stop by Have a real piece of pie here Lifelines Where would we be without lifelines When we're lost at sea The devil's got you thinking That the boat ain't sinking But you're boots are getting wet That's the thing about lifelines They tell you the truth When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime So thank God for lifelines Where would we be without lifelines When we're lost at sea The devil's got you thinking That the boat ain't sinking But you're boots are sure getting wet That's the thing about lifelines They tell you the truth When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime So thank God for lifelines Thank God for lifelines
