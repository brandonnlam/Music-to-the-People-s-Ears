   This town she is a temptress. A siren with gold eyes she'll cut you with her kindness She will lead you with her lies. She's been called a glistening devil. She's good at keeping score. If you make it she's your savior if you don't she's a whore. The roads to and from her heart are littered with grave souls. They gave all of their all and all they got in return is empty holes. Sure we've all heard about Shell and Chris Willy and Bobby Bares. She'd smiled on Johnny's the Merles any music-wrote billionaires. Like a beacon she goes seeking seed her loins so fertile. To a free man she's a prison to a caged one she's a fire. She's the reason there's a Sunday morning coming down. I saw the light A Boy Named Sue He stopped loving her today. The pill and 16th avenue. The rhyming oh she's a diamond the brown eyed mickey She was Roy acuffs castle and elvis parsley's broken dream It's not all bad it's not all dark it's not all gloom and crass But to mine gold in this silver mine it does take balls of brass. For she's seem 'em come and seen 'em go And came herself a time or two. No matter How satisfied her scream sounds she always wants someone new. The next him or her or them or all... To be a star in this lady's town... You can fuck or you can fight. You see it all comes down to money. Not romantic art of days gone past if you forget that rule You can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass. A tramp a s a bitch a mutt a thousand pawn shop guitars. A nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart. She lurks in friendly shadows but she's a junky with a limb. The agents are her bookie and the labels are her pen. I'll tell you a well-known secret of a place known far and wide The devil walks among us folks and Nashville is his bride. All the chaos he has caused and done. His greatest tribute to every guitar-totin' dreamer The devil don't... But me I shook his hand. And I know that he is real. So devil you can go screw yourself and then go straight the hell.
