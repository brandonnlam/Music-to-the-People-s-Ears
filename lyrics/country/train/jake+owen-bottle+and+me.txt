   Didn't come in here for your sympathy And a honky tonk queen's the last thing I need. Just set me up with your best whiskey. This is just between the bottle and me. I don't want to talk. I don't need a friend. Don't think I stuttered when I said I'm here to deal with a memory. Yeah this is just between the bottle and me. A man can't face the cold hard truth With nothing less than 90 proof. And closing time is when I'll leave. Till then it's just between the bottle and me. You're a good bartender. I know you want to help. So if you see me talking to myself Just walk away and let me be. Yeah this is just between the bottle and me. A man can't face the cold hard truth With nothing less than 90 proof. And closing time is when I'll leave. Till then it's just between this bottle and me.
