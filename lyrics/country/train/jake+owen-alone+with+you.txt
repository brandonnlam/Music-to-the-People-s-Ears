   I don't see you laugh You don't call me back But you kiss me when you're drunk I don't know your friends Don't know where you've been Why are you the one I want Don't put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can't stay Don't slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it's okay Don't say it doesn't matter cause it's gonna matter to me I can't be alone with You've got me out on the edge every time you call And I know it would kill me if I fall I can't be alone with you Pleas don't chain that door I can't win this war Your body's like a pill I shouldn't take Don't put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can't stay Don't slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it's okay Don't say it doesn't matter cause it's gonna matter to me I can't be alone with You've got me out on the edge every time you call And I know it would kill me if I fall I can't be alone with you I can't be alone with you Don't put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can't stay Don't slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it's okay Don't say you're gonna love me cause you're gonna love me and leave I can't be alone with You've got me out on the edge every time you call And I know it would kill me if I fall I can't be alone with you I don't see you laugh You don't call me back But you kiss me when you're drunk
