   I miss my baby so much  After being gone  Out on that lake uh fishin' All weekend long  So I bought flowers and a bottle of the good stuff  But when I walked in I knew well I didn't bring enough Cause' she ain't as happy as I am to be home  If looks could kill then I'd be cold as a stone. I'm already ready to kiss and makeup Looks like tonight I'm outta luck oh lord She'd rather fight then you know what. Had reservations at the Japanese steak house  Don't need to go where their throwing knives around  Just take my ear full of all the wrong I've done  Just get it over while she tears me a knew one  She ain't as happy as I am to be home  If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone. I'm already ready to kiss and makeup Looks like tonight I'm outta luck  Cause' She'd rather fight then you know  What I'd like to do  If I could just somehow get her in the mood Oh but I can see right now She ain't as happy as I am to be home  If looks could kill then I'd be cold as a stone. I'm already ready to kiss and makeup Looks like tonight I'm outta luck oh lord Cause' She'd rather fight then you know what. I might be sleeping in my truck  Cause she'd rather fight then you know what. You know what I love you  Don't you like what I got you  I'm out here if you need me  Oh my back is sunburned  I think it's sunburned baby  Got some aloe
