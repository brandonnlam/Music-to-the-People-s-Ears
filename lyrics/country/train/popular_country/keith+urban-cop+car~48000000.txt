   We drove right past That no trespassing sign We sat on the tailgate And watched the planes take off We thought we had all night There was no need to rush That's when those cops Came pulling up And I thought Man ain't this some shhhh Your daddy's gonna kill me But if I survive tonight I wouldn't change one thing Baby yeah I know it sounds crazy Side by side And locked in tight They were taking their time But we didn't mind We talked And we laughed We sat real close By the time they let us go I was already gone
