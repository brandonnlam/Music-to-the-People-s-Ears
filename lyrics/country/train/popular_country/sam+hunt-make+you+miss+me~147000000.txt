   You hear a new song it's your favorite Pretty soon you'll be changing the station And all your old shoes are looking brand new They wanna be worn but they never get the chance too Heavy into everything Ready for the next thing Catch a ride for a while than you're over it You change your mind on it Soon as the shines gone Like you always do but you don't know it yet but Woahhhhh whoahhh I ain't gunna be that easy to leave Woahhhh whoahhh Girl I'm gunna make you miss me Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me Gunna make you miss me You're cold and hot You burn out like a match Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach You think it's easy but that's a lie The only reason that you're good at goodbye is Every boy you ever met was to easy to forget Well I ain't going out like that Woahhh whoahh I ain't gunna be that easy to leave Woahhh whoahhh Girl I'm gunna make you miss me Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me I'm gunna make you miss me Woahhh whoahh I ain't gunna be that easy to leave Woahhhh whoahhh Girl I'm gunna make you miss me Writing letters that you're never gunna mail Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me I'm gunna make you miss me Make you miss me Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands I'll say baby you know all you can say Is come and get me Wanna make you miss me Gunna make you miss me And ohhhh ohhh ohhh I'm gunna make you miss me
