   Hey y'all watch this Daddy's belt mamas drapes Standin' tall on the backyard shed Lookin' cool in my superman cape I told the neighbourhood girls Said hey y'all watch this My fate was a broken arm And my reward a one day kiss When daddy asked me why I did it I made him laugh out loud when I told him Cause the chicks dig it Scars heal... Glory fades And all we're left with are the memories made oh yeah Pain hurts but only for a minute Yeah life is short so go on and live it Cause the chicks dig it Oh yeah Mmmm Black top road learner permit Thought I was earnhardt Drivin' fast but I didn't see the ditch Took out a mailbox then a fence then a barn The police came and called my father But I met the farmer's daughter And when the judge asked me why I did it He threw the book at me when I told him Cause the chicks dig it Scars heal... Glory fades And all we're left with are the memories made oh yeah Pain hurts but only for a minute Life is short so go on and live it Cause the chicks dig it Oh yeah Ohh oh Just throw caution to the wind my friend And then sit back and watch your life begin cause Scars heal... Glory fades And all we're left with are the memories made Yeah pain hurts but only for a minute Yeah life's short so go on and live it Cause the chicks dig it Scars heal... Glory fades And all we're left with are the memories made Pain hurts but only for a minute Yeah life is short so go on and live it It don't matter if you lose or if you win it Hey the chicks dig it Oh yeah Chicks dig it Mmm The chicks dig it Ah hey aw yeah The chicks dig it I got this scar when I was three years old showing off for the girl next door On my tricycle And the on over my eye well I got that back in '82 jumpin' off the train Tressele bridge But I got the girl hah oh The chicks dig it
