   These four walls of Fort Worth Are closin' in on me My final meal is over They're gonna to set me free I can feel the fires a burnin' As the devil guards my door I hit my knees in search of Jesus On a cold jailhous floor Lord now I'm singin' Get me out of here I see the preacher's eyes As my daughter cries When they strap me in this chair Lord I hope she forgives me For livin' my life this way Tonight I'll ride the lightning To my final judgement day Every life owes a debt That's what the Bible says I owe mine to this state For shootin' that boy to death A liquor store attendant He was reachin' for his gun Now his mama sits there smilin' As the boss yells Roll on one And now I'm singin' Get me out of here I see the preacher's eyes As my daugher cries When they strap me in this chair I hope she forgives me For leavin' her this way Tonight I'll ride the lightining To my final resting place A hungry blue-eyed baby cryin' Made me rob that store And as that boy lay there dyin' I dropped my pistol on the floor Yeah I'd take it all back But there's nothin' I can do They've covered my face And the order's gone through As the boss yells Roll on two Now I'm flyin' up and outta here I close my eyes and slowly rise Let my body leave this chair Lord I hope you forgive me For livin' my life this way Tonight I ride the lightning To my final resting place These four walls of Fort Worth Are closin' in on me
