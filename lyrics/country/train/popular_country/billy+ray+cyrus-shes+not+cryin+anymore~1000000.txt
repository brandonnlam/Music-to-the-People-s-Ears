   She used to cry when I'd come home late She couldn't buy the lies I told All she wanted was to be needed Someone that she could call her own The love I know I took for granted Until she walked out of my door Too little too late to say I'm sorry 'Cause she's not cryin' anymore She's not cryin' anymore She ain't lonely any longer There's a smile upon her face A new love takes my place She's not cryin' anymore I hear she's really doin' well now She's picked herself up off the ground I wasn't there when I was needed But I was there to let her down Sometimes you know I feel so foolish If I knew then what I know now Another tear would never fall 'Cause I'd give our love my all If we could work things out somehow She's not cryin' anymore She ain't lonely any longer There's a smile upon her face A new love takes my place She's not cryin' anymore She's not cryin' anymore She ain't lonely any longer There's a smile upon her face A new love takes my place She's not cryin' anymore There's a smile upon her face A new love takes my place She's not cryin' any more
