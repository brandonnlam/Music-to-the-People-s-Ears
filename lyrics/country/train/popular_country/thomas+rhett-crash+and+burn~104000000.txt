   So I guess it's over baby and déjà vu again Who'd have thought that time don't stop and Somehow girl the world keeps spinning and I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes That I am Do you hear that I'm right back At the sound of lonely calling Do you hear that It's where I'm at It's the sound of teardrops falling down down A slamming door and a lesson learned I let another love crash and burn I know that it might sound jaded And man I have to say I think love is overrated But I don't like throwing it away I know you could probably tell me Right where I went wrong Some guys can't have all the luck If others don't sing sad songs Do you hear that I'm right back At the sound of lonely calling Do you hear that It's where I'm at It's the sound of teardrops falling down down A slamming door and a lesson learned I let another lover crash and burn that's right Another lover Another lover crash and burn Ooh yeah Do you hear that I'm right back At the sound of lonely calling Do you hear that It's where I'm at It's the sound of teardrops falling down down A slamming door and a lesson learned I let another lover crash and burn yeah I let another lover crash and burn Mhm Mhm
