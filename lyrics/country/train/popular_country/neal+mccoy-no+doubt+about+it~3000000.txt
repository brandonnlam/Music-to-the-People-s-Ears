   Just like every lock's got to have a key Every river flows looking for the sea And when you plant a seed it reaches for the sky That's just the way it is nobody wonders why Like coffee needs a cup you know that it ain't much good without it We were meant to be together no doubt about it Like a hammer and a nail socks and shoes We go hand in hand like a rhythm and blues What good is a man who hasn't got a dream Bout as good as a car with no gasoline You're the one I'm dreaming of got to have your love can't live without it We were meant to be together no doubt about it No there ain't no doubt about it Something was missing it was making me blue But all I ever needed was you Just like every lock's got to have a key Every river flows lookin' for the sea And when you plant a seed it reaches for the sky That's just the way it is girl with you and I Like coffee needs a cup you know that it ain't much good without it We were meant to be together no doubt about it No there ain't no doubt about it Like a hammer and a nail socks and shoes We go hand in hand like a rhythm and blues What good is a man who hasn't got a dream 'Bout as good as a car with no gasoline You're the one I'm dreaming of got to have your love can't live without it We were meant to be together no doubt about it
