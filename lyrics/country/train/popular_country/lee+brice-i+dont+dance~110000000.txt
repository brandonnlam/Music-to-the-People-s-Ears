   I'll never settle down That's what I always thought I was that kind of man Just ask anyone I don't dance But here I am Spinning you 'round And 'round in circles It ain't my style But I don't care I'd do anything With you anywhere Guess you got me In the palm of your hand Cause I don't dance Love's never come my way I've never been this far But you took these two left feet And waltzed away with my heart I don't dance But here I am Spinning you 'round And 'round in circles It ain't my style But I don't care I'd do anything With you anywhere Guess you got me In the palm of Your hand girl Cause I don't dance I don't dance But here I am Spinning you 'round And 'round in circles It ain't my style But I don't care I'd do anything With you anywhere I don't dance But here I am Spinning you 'round And 'round in circles It ain't my style But I don't care I'd do anything With you anywhere Yeah you've got me In the palm of your hand girl Cause I don't dance
