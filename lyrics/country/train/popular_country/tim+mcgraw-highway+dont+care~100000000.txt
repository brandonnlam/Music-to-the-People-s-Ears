   Bet your window’s rolled down and your hair’s pulled back I bet you got no idea you’re going way too fast And you’re trying not to think about what went wrong Trying not to stop til you get where you goin’ Trying to stay awake so I bet you turned on the radio And the song goes I can’t live without you I can’t live without you baby I can’t live without you I can’t live without you baby baby The highway won’t hold you tonight The highway don’t know you’re alive The highway don’t care if you’re all alone But I do I do. The highway won’t dry your tears The highway don’t need you here The highway don’t care if you’re coming home But I do I do. I bet you got a dead cell phone in the shot gun seat Yeah I bet you’re bending God’s ear talking about me. You’re trying not to let the first tear fall out Trying not to think about turning around Trying not to get lost in sound but that song is always on So you sing along I can’t live without you I can’t live without you baby I can’t live without I can’t live without you baby baby The Highway won’t hold you tonight The highway don’t know you’re alive The highway don’t care if you’re all alone But I do I do The highway won’t dry your tears The highway don’t need you here The highway don’t care if you’re coming home But I do I do. I can’t live without you I can’t live without you baby I can’t live without I can’t live without you baby baby The highway don’t care The highway don’t care The highway don’t care But I do I do
