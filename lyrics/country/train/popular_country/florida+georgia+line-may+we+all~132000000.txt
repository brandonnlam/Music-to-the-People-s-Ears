   Featuring Tim McGraw  May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town Get a one star hand me down Ford to try to fix up With some part time cash from driving a tractor Find a sweet little thang wears your ball cap backwards Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does Cause you miss it too much  May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new one The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac Hope you get lost down some road Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window Where you 'bout to go Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just frefall May we all  May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up And know that fifteen minutes of fame  ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes  May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new one The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac Hope you get lost down some road Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window Where you 'bout to go Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall May we all  May we all do a little bit better than the first time Learn a little something from the worst times Get a little stronger from the hurt times May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one  and we crashed one Keep hoping that the best one is the last one  Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall May we all May we all May we all May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one May we all  and we crashed one May we all keep hoping that the best one is the last one (yeah the last one Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall May we all
