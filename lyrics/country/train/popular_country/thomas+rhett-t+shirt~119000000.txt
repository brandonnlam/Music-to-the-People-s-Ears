    Get off work and we meet down at our spot We had a patio with a view of a parking lot It was two for one and four for two Had Christmas lights in the middle of June All hung up like I was on you  I said hey hey baby do you wanna come over You say no way then you move in closer Next thing I know you were wearing my  T-shirt right there Your hair messed up like a Guns N' Roses video Oh oh so hot Still got it up in my head You were moving around in the TV light I ain't ever seen anything like Your dress my floor The way you wore my T-shirt  We were walking up the stairs With the neighbors saying keep it down But it's hard to unlock the door When you're making out You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this So why you leanin' in for one more kiss And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on And slippin' into my  T-shirt right there Your hair messed up like a Guns N' Roses video Oh oh so hot Still got it up in my head You were moving around in the TV light I ain't ever seen anything like Your dress my floor The way you wore my T-shirt  I said hey hey baby do you wanna come over You say no way then you move in closer Next thing I know you were wearing my  T-shirt right there Your hair messed up like a Guns N' Roses video Oh oh so hot I can see you spinning around in my T-shirt right there Your hair messed up like a Guns N' Roses video Oh oh so hot Still got it up in my head You were moving around in the TV light I ain't ever seen anything like Your dress my floor The way you wore my T-shirt
