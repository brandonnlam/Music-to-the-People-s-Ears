   Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford Flies found the hole in the old screen door Granny said the dress that my sister wore To church wasn't long enough Momma poured grease in a Chrisco can Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand Where them yellow jacket's torn me up And I ain't making this up Oh you think I'm talking crazy In a different language you might not understand Oh that's alright That's just the kind of life that made me who I am Just taking my mind on a visit Back in time 'cause I miss it You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it Unless you lived it And man I lived it Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up Drove me around in the back of that truck We drank from the hose and spit in the cup We all survived somehow Them old Duke boys they're flattening their heels Hollywood was fake wrestling was real Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill From pushing a lawnmower ‘round I go back there right now Oh you think I'm talking crazy In a different language you might not understand Oh that's alright That's just the kind of life that made me who I am Just taking my mind on a visit Back in time 'cause I miss it You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it Unless you lived it And man I lived it Oh man I lived it Oh you think I'm talking crazy In a different language you might not understand Oh that's alright That's just the kind of life that made me who I am Just taking my mind on a visit Back in time 'cause I miss it You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it Unless you lived it And man I lived it Oh man I lived it
