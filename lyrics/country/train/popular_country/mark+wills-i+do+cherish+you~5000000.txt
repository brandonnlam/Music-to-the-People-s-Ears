   All I am all I'll be Everything in this world all that I'll ever need Is in your eyes shining at me When you smile I can feel all my passion unfolding Your hand brushes mine And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I I do cherish you For the rest of my life You don't have to think twice I will love you still from the depths of my soul It's beyond my control I've waited so long to say this to you If you're asking do I love you this much I do In my world before you I lived outside my emotions Didn't know where I was going Until that day I found you How you opened my life to a new paradise In a world torn by change Still with all of my heart until my dying day I do cherish you For the rest of my life You don't have to think twice I will love you still from the depths of my soul It's beyond my control I've waited so long to say this to you If you're asking do I love you this much yes I do I've waited so long to say this to you So if you're asking if I love you this much I do Oh I do
