   Miss me baby When you hear our favorite song Miss me baby And when you start to sing along Think about all the times that we danced In the light to it all night long oh Then miss me baby And want me honey Like you did the night you told me that you loved me We couldn't wait anymore left the keys in the door Took my hand pulled me down on the kitchen floor Yeah we were that crazy Miss me baby Because when he's holding you Know that it's killing me Let my memory be the reason girl That you can't sleep And every time you feel his touch I pray to God it's not enough And that I've touched your heart so deep Girl you can't shake me 'Cause I love you yes I need you Miss me baby Miss me baby Until you can't take it no more Miss me baby Pack your bags and hit the door I'm a man I was wrong forgive me Come back home I'll be waiting right here waiting Miss me baby Because when he's holding you Know that it's killing me Let my memory be the reason girl That you can't sleep And every time you feel his touch I pray to God it's not enough And that I've touched your heart so deep Girl you can't shake me 'Cause I love you yes I love you Miss me baby And every time you feel his touch I pray to God it's not enough And that I've touched your heart so deep Girl you can't shake me 'Cause I love you yes I need you Miss me baby Every time you hear this song Miss me baby
