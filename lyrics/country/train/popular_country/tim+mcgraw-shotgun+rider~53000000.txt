    Roll won't you come roll with me  Slow fast full speed Girl wherever sweet time takes us Hang with me down this old road Only god knows where we'll go Don't matter long as I've got your love Slide slide over nice and close Lay your head down on my shoulder You can fall asleep I'll let you Dream life aint nothing but a dream don't wanna be  Cruisin' through this dream without you
