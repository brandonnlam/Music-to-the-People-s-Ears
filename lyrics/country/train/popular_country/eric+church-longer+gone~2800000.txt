   Honey honey Honey you still prey on my mind I tried thumbin' a freight train jumpin' Baby nothin' leaves you behind So I jump up find me a mountain Shake of the sheep I been countin' Chase that sun 'til it runs out of sky And if your memory's still too strong I'll keep movin' on and get longer gone Now there are those who Swear that I belong in a padded room 'Cause I can't sleep baby you keep Creepin' up like the light of a crescent moon So I jump up find me a mountain Shake of the sheep I been countin' Chase that sun 'til it runs out of sky And if your memory's still too strong I'll keep movin' on and get longer gone It would be easy if I never loved you I found someone new but until I do I jump up find me a mountain Shake of the sheep I been countin' Chase that sun 'til it runs out of sky And if your memory's still too strong I'll keep movin' on and get longer And get longer gone longer gone Honey honey Honey you still prey on my mind
