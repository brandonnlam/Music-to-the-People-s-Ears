    When the sun had left and the winter came And the sky fall could only bring the rain I sat in darkness all broken hearted I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone I never meant to cry started losing hope But somehow baby you broke through and saved me  You're an angel tell me you're never leaving Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in  You're holy holy holy holy I'm high on loving you high on loving you You're holy holy holy holy I'm high on loving you high on loving you  You made the brightest days from the darkest nights You're the river bank where I was baptized Cleanse all the demons That were killing my freedom Let me lay you down give me to ya Get you singing babe hallelujah We'll be touching we'll be touching heaven  You're an angel tell me you're never leaving Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in  You're holy holy holy holy I'm high on loving you high on loving you You're holy holy holy holy I'm high on loving you high on loving you  I don't need the stars cause you shine for me Like fire in my veins you're my ecstasy you're my ecstasy  You're holy holy holy holy I'm high on loving you high on loving you You're holy holy holy holy I'm high on loving you high on loving you  You're the healing hands where it used to hurt You're my saving grace you're my kind of church You're holy
