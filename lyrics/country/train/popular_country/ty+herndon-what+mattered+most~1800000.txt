   I thought I knew the girl so well If she was sad I couldn't tell I missed the point I missed the signs So if she's gone the fault is mine I know I know a whole lot of little things And even though I could list them 1 by 1 She would still be gone Chorus: Her eyes are blue Her hair was long 64 she was born in Baton Rouge Her favorite song is  In My Life I memorized her every move I knew her books her car her clothes But I paid no attention to what mattered most I never ask she never said And when she cried I turned my head She dreamed her dreams behind closed doors That made them easy to ignore And I know I know I missed the forest for the trees And all I have to show Oh but she walked out the door Her cold facts and nothing more Her eyes are blue Her hair was long In 64 she was born in Baton Rouge Her favorite song is  In My Life I memorized her every move I knew her books her car her clothes But I paid no attention to what mattered most Her eyes are blue Her hair was long In 64 she was born in Baton Rouge Her fathers tall Her mothers gone She moved out west when she was 2 The way she laughed The way she loved Oh my God what did I do
