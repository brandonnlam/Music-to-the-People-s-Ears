   She's gotta do what she's gotta do And I've gotta like it or not She's got dreams too big for this town And she needs to give 'em a shot Whatever they are Looks like she's all ready to leave Nothing left to pack Ain't no room for me in that car Even if she asked me to tag along God I gotta be strong She's at the startin' line of the rest of her life As ready as she's ever been Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes The prize is hers to win She's waitin' on my blessings Before she hits that open road But baby get ready get set don't go She says things are fallin' in place Feels like they're fallin' apart I painted this big old smile on my face To hide my broken heart If only she knew This is where I don't say What I want so bad to say This is where I want to But I won't get in the way Of her and her dreams And spreadin' her wings She's at the startin' line of the rest of her life As ready as she's ever been Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes The prize is hers to win She's waitin' on my blessings Before she hits that open road But baby get ready get set don't go She's at the startin' line of the rest of her life As ready as she's ever been Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes The prize is hers to win She's waitin' on my blessings Before she hits that open road But baby get ready get set please don't go Don't go mmm don't go She's gotta do what she's gotta do She's gotta do what she's gotta do
