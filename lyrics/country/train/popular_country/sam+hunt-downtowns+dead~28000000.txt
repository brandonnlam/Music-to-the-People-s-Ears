   The city’s so in style All you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars Man I love these bars are making a killin' Everywhere I go looks like the place to be I see people that I know  And I feel like there’s no one here but me Downtown’s dead without you Girls walk by and friends say hi Then Friday night it might as well be just another Tuesday night without you As long as you’re still in my head There ain’t a way that I can paint a ghost town red Downtown’s dead downtown’s dead They're dancing in the strobes  Out here in the throws of loud house music Everything’s a blur I don’t hear the words but lips are moving I try to get involved  But I’ve about had enough of people wall to the wall And I’m just holdin' it up 'cause Downtown’s dead without you Girls walk by and friends say hi Then Friday night it might as well be just another Tuesday night without you As long as you’re still in my head There ain’t a way that I can paint a ghost town red Downtown’s dead downtown’s dead Free drinks bright lights  What am I doing with my life Okay I quit I’ve had enough of this 'Cause people are losing their minds  Can’t get you out of my head I’m calling it a night I’m crawling back to your bed Downtown’s dead without you Girls walk by and friends say hi Then Friday night it might as well be just another Tuesday night without you As long as you’re still in my head There ain’t a way that I can paint a ghost town red Downtown’s dead downtown’s dead
