   I remember the summer I turned 16. And that old Jalapoy daddy gave to me. It had holes in the floor and just a 305. But I didn't care cause I could finally drive. There wasn't much to do in my hometown So every weekend night we would all go down Yeah there were freaks and hippies in my high school. Football players all trying to be cool. And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer when the cops drove by till the coast was clear. Kids falling in a out of love on the hoods of Chevy's in the beds of trucks. We were stumbling our way through life till our senior year. But man we sure did learn a lot in that Wal mart parking lot. She had long blonde hair and sea green eyes. The most beautiful thang I'd ever seen in my life. But I was young and dumb and didn't have a line. And all I could say was can I call you sometime. She just said no and walked away. And that was the first time I felt my heart break. Yeah there were freaks and hippies in my high school. Football players trying to be cool. And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer when the cops drove by till the coast was clear. Kids falling in and out of love on the hoods of chevys in the beds of trucks.
