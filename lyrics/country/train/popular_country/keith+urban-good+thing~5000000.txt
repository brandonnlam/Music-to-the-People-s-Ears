   Mmm just hold it now let me put my drink down Baby tell me are you really for real Swingin side-to-side doin that electric slide Spinnin on your pretty little cowgirl boot heels And you're all alone and that ain't right A girl like you should have the best of everything Like someone to treat you right What I wouldnt give to hold you close Longer than tonight Chorus: Cause I know a good thing when I see it And you got somethin like I aint never see before Yeah I know a sweet dream when I dream it Just give me one chance and youll never be lonely no more The possibilities mmm theyre killin me Like youre killin every dude in the room with the way you move And you ain't slowin down my heads spinnin' round But this neon buzz is a-gettin me up and I wanna get down with you Repeat Chorus Solo Repeat Chorus
