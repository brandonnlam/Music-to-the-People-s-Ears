    Girl getting over him and I'm getting over her The eyes have it made ain't gotta say a word Misery loves company that's why it's you and me Buying each other drinks back at the bar thick as thieves Stealing these little sips Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it  Keep playing them songs keep singing along Keep leaning it on in closer Keep salting the rim getting even with her Getting even with him before the night is over That first kiss is like a Colorado hit You better keep on keeping it lit 'Til we can't remember Can't remember why we came here to forget  Go ahead and check your phone like I've been checking mine Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind Looks like it's just me and you Falling in love just enough to get us through While we're getting through  Keep playing them songs keep singing along Keep leaning it on in closer Keep salting the rim getting even with her And even with him before the night is over That first kiss is like a Colorado hit You better keep on keeping it lit 'Til we can't remember Can't remember why we came here to forget  First of all we came here to forget Looks like it's just me and you Falling in love just enough to get us through While we're getting through  Keep playing them songs keep singing along Keep leaning it on in closer Keep salting the rim getting even with her And even with him before the night is over That first kiss is like a Colorado hit You better keep on keeping it lit 'Til we can't remember Can't remember why we came here to forget  Why we came here to forget Why we came here to forget Baby baby That's why we came here to forget
