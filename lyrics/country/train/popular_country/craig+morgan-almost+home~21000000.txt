   He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes He was covered with the evening news Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands The bank sign was flashing 5 below It was freezing rain and spittin' snow He was curled up behind some garbage cans I was afraid that he was dead I gave him a gentle shake When he opened up his eyes I said Old man are you ok He said I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home He said I was just comin' round the barn 'Bout the time you grabbed my arm When I heard Momma holler Son hurry up I was close enough for my old nose To smell fresh cobbler on the stove And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck Cane poles on the tailgate Bobbers blowin' in the wind Since July of '55 That's as close as I've been He said I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home I said Old man you're gonna freeze to death Let me drive you to the mission He said Boy if you'd left me alone Right now I'd be fishin' He said I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree I was runnin' from some honey bees Drip dryin' in the summer breeze After jumpin' into Calico creek I was walkin' down an old dirt road Past a field of hay that had just been mowed Man I wish you'd just left me alone 'Cause I was almost home Man I wish you'd just left me alone Cause I was almost home almost home Man I wish you'd just left me alone I was almost home
