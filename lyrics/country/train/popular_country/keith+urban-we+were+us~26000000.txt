   Rearview crosses Railroad ties Oh Hail Marys Friday nights Heartbeat baby Low-beam lights God I miss when you were mine Chorus: Back when that song was a song I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on Every beat every line every word every time When a road was a road I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you Money was gas dreams were dust Love was fast and we were us Shotgun sunset A cool mint kiss Backseat promise Breaking it Floorboard feeling County lines God I miss when you were mine Chorus: Back when that song was a song I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on Every beat every line every word every time When a road was a road I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you Money was gas dreams were dust Love was fast and we were us In a sleepy town just jumping in Far too young to know that summers end We were us we can't go back It's what it is but God I miss Chorus: Back when that song was a song I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on Every beat every line every word every time When a road was a road I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you Money was gas dreams were dust Love was fast and we were us Every beat every line every word every single time I just close my eyes and youre ridin shotgun You and me baby on the run I miss baby I can feel your heartbeat baby
