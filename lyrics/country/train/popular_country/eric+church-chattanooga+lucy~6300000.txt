   Two miles east of the Chickamauga Just over the hill and across the holla End of the path leading from the water There's a one room a frame house Hot pie potbelly stove When she workin' the flame it never get cold The only place on Earth I know It gets hotter when the sun goes down Oh my my Chattanooga Lucy Woman what it is you do to me Forbidden fruit it sure is juicy You got me comin' around comin' around Oh my my Chattanooga Lucy Break me easy or bend me bluesy Hold on tight or hold on loosely Keep me comin' around comin' around Post my bail and pay my bounty Anything to get me down to Hamilton County Up and down and all around me Every time I hear the sound Every time I hear the sound Oh my my Chattanooga Lucy Woman what it is you do to me Forbidden fruit it sure is juicy You got me comin' around comin' around Oh my my Chattanooga Lucy Break me easy or bend me bluesy Hold on tight or hold on loosely Keep me comin' around comin' around Yeah I come undone Every time I get some Kickdrum guitar strum No matter where you come from Oh my my Chattanooga Lucy Woman what it is you do to me Forbidden fruit it sure is juicy You got me comin' around comin' around Yeah oh my my Chattanooga Lucy Break me easy or bend me bluesy Hold on tight or hold on loosely Keep me comin' around comin' around Keep me comin' around comin' around Yeah I come undone Every time I get some Kickdrum guitar strum She's everything but a shy one
