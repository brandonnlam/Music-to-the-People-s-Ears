   Sunday morning man she woke up fighting mad Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had And by Tuesday you could say that girl was good as gone And then when Thursday came around I was all alone So I went for a drive to clear my mind ended up at a Shell on I-65 Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it She swore they were a waist of time oh but she was wrong I was caller number five on a radio station won a four-day three-night beach vacation Deep sea senorita fishing down in Panama And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore Oh lord when it rains it pours Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize When she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore Oh lord when it rains it pours When it rains it pours And I've been on a hell of a redneck road for three weeks now And it all started on the day that she walked out Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it She swore they were a waist of time oh but she was wrong I was caller number five on a radio station won a four-day three-night beach vacation Deep sea senorita fishing down in Panama And I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore Oh lord when it rains it pours When it rains it pours
