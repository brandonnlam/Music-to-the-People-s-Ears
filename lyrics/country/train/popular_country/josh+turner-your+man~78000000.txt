Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low Put some music on that's soft and slow Baby we aint got no place to go I hope you understand I've been thinkin bout this all day long Never felt a feelin quite this strong I can't believe how much it turns me on Just to be your man There's no hurry don't you worry We can take our time Come a little closer Lets go over what I had in mind Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low Put some music on that's soft and slow Baby we aint got no place to go I hope you understand I've been thinkin bout this all day long Never felt a feelin quite this strong I can't believe how much it turns me on Just to be your man Aint nobody ever loved nobody The way that I love you Were alone now You don't know how long I've wanted to Lock the door and turn the lights down low Put some music on that's soft and slow Baby we aint got no place to go I hope you understand I've been thinkin bout this all day long Never felt a feelin that was quite this strong I can't believe how much it turns me on Just to be your man I can't believe how much it turns me on just to be your man
