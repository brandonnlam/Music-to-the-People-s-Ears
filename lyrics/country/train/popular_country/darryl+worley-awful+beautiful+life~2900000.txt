   I woke up early with a poundin' in my head I'd been out the night before with all my friends A little worried kinda wonderin' what I did I said  Lord please forgive me for my sins. My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first "You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church. I love this crazy tragic Sometimes almost magic Awful beautful life I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along And made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake We met the family for dinner at our home Drank some beer watched a game And cooked some steaks My little brother had a big fight with his wife And my poor mother sat between'em both all night I love this crazy tragic Sometimes almost magic Awful beautful life We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq We're all aware that he may never make it back We talked about the way  we missed his stupid jokes And how he loved to be a soldier more than most I laid in bed that night and thought about the day And how my life is like a roller coaster ride The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight You can't really smile until you've she'd some tears I could die today or I might live on for years I love this crazy tragic Sometimes almost magic Awful beautful life I love this crazy tragic Sometimes almost magic Awful beautful life Alright It's a beautiful life Awful beautiful life I love this life It's a beautiful life
