   You were too bad for a little square town With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground Heard you cussed out mamma pushed daddy around You tore off in his car Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets Tattoo on your neck fake gold on your teeth Got the hood here snow but you can't fool me we both know who you are Homeboy your gonna wish one day You were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake With your high school flame on one side ice cold beer on the other Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty Little house little kids little small town story If you don't ever do anything else for me just do this for me brother Come on home boy I's haulin' this hay Uncle Joe's farm Thought of us bare foot kids in the yard Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn Now you're caught up in this mess I can use a little help unloadin' these bails I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail Ain't a glamorous life but it'll keep you outta jail And not worry us all to death Homeboy your gonna wish one day You were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake With your high school flame on one side ice cold beer on the other Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty Little house little kids little small town story If you don't ever do anything else for me just do this for me brother Come on home boy You can't hold back the hands of time Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind I wish you'd come on back and make it alright Before they're called... Home boy Homeboy Come on home boy Homeboy Come on home boy
