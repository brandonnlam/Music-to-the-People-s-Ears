    There's something 'bout yesterday How fast it all flies away I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss That makes you wanna stay We were crazy then we were over We were breaking up making love a runaway roller coaster  Every time I hear that song I’m standing in the pouring rain On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh I still think about you oh-oh-oh Every time I hear that song It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh I still think about you oh-oh-oh I still think about you  There’s something in the bittersweet The feeling of a memory Right there in the moment All I ever wanted was you and me We were crying we were wasted We were dying when they played it  Every time I hear that song I’m standing in the pouring rain On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh I still think about you oh-oh-oh Every time I hear that song It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh I still think about you oh-oh-oh I still think about you Oh I still think about you  There's a soundtrack in my mind That takes me back in time When I hear that melody I think about you and me  Every time I hear that song I’m standing in the pouring rain On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh I still think about you oh-oh-oh Every time I hear that song It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh I still think about you oh-oh-oh I still think about you Oh I still think about you I still think about you Yeah I still think about you  There's a soundtrack in my mind That takes me back in time When I hear that melody
