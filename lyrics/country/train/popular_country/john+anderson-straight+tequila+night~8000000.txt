   If you really wanna know She comes here alot She just loves to hear the music and dance K13 is her favorite song If you play it you might have a chance Tonight she's only sippin' white wine She's friendly and fun-lovin' most of the time But don't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him And she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila night Here's a glass of Chablis Some quarters and change Maybe you can turn her lovelife around Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore To shoot that ol' memory down Just remember her heart's on the mend If you ever come back to see her again Don't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him And she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila night Don't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him And she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila night Don't ask her on a straight Tequila night She'll start thinkin' about him And she's ready to fight Blames her broken heart on every man in sight On a straight Tequila night (repeat chorus and fade out
