   Her kisses taste like whiskey Burnin' through my veins She don't know how to miss me She hits right where she aims Baby's got my number and she's calling me up Knows what she's doing with a single touch She's turning me on turning me on Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing If I'm what she wants she gets what she wants The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string Turning me on like it's her job Sometimes I think she must get off on Turning me on turning me on Knows how to set me on fire She's always holding the match And when my body's beside hers There ain't no turning back She's Revlon red in the blackest night Lighting up the room in the world just like She's turning me on turning me on Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing If I'm what she wants she gets what she wants The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string Turning me on like it's her job Sometimes I think she must get off on Turning me on turning me on Once she gets it started Man it's all night long She's the needle on the vinyl Of a midnight song She's turning me on turning me on She's turning me on turning me on Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing If I'm what she wants she gets what she wants The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string Turning me on like it's her job Sometimes I think she must get off on Turning me on turning me on yeah Turning me on turning me on Turning me on turning me on Turning me on turning me on (Turning me turning me turning me turning me turning me on Oooh oooh oooh Turning me turning me turning me turning me turning me on Oooh oooh oooh Turning me turning me turning me turning me turning me on Oooh oooh oooh
