   She was a real deal farmer's daughter Raised on corn bread drank well water. The girl next door but a little bit hotter Than anything you ever saw. One Carolina night in the summer heat At a bonfire party tucked back in the trees I was sittin' there sippin' on an ice cold beer When she whispered in my ear: Meet me in the barn way out in the pasture Turn off your headlights park by the tractor Sneak in the backdoor so we don't get caught I'll be there waitin' in the hayloft. With a kiss on my lips no you don't wanna miss Holdin' me in your arms... Meet me in the barn. Yeah we could've lit that big red barn on fire From a spark to a flame burnin' higher and higher Everything a country boy's heart desires Was in a little white cotton dress. Oh yeah She had lips that taste like watermelon wine Sweet like the sugar on the honeysuckle vine Rollin' around in hay bale bed All because she said: Meet me in the barn way out in the pasture Turn off your headlights park by the tractor Sneak in the backdoor so we don't get caught I'll be there waitin' in the hayloft. With a kiss on my lips no you don't wanna miss Holdin' me in your arms... Meet me in the barn. I still think about That sweet love we made. I close my eyes And I can hear her say: "Hey country boy won't you meet me in the barn Meet me in the barn way out in the pasture Turn off your headlight park by the tractor Sneak in the backdoor so we don't get caught I'll be there waitin' in the hayloft. With a kiss on my lips no you don't wanna miss Holdin' me in your arms... Meet me in the barn. Hey country boy won't you meet me in the barn We'll dance real close with the radio on Hey country boy won't you meet me in the barn Wanna spend all night in your arms
