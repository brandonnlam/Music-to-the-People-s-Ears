   Bonus Track Mama used to teach And preacher used to preach There's Angels watching over me There here to shield you So you don't yield To the Devil when your soul gets weak But their hard to hear When you're jamming gears And they're always hanging back Yeah they try to chase But if they want to save me They better step on the gas Cause I'm living faster than my angels can fly Yeah I've been wearing the wings off mine I'm bound to die I live and lie Faster than my angels can fly Yeah faster than my angels can fly There's days I regret This hitch in my step And scars on my boots and hands All those times I've rushed To get growed up In a hurry to become a man And the promises I've made And the hearts I break All in the name of fun Yeah I apologize But I've got no time For no tie me up slow me down love I'm living faster than my angels can fly Yeah I've been wearing the wings off mine Yeah I'm bound to die I live and lie Faster than my angels can fly Yeah faster than my angels can fly Yeah I'm slowed down I ain't what I was Still they ain't got a prayer Of ever catchin up Cause I was born to run born to run born to run Faster than my angels can fly Yeah I've been wearing the wings off mine Yeah I'm bound to die I live and lie Faster than my angels can fly Yeah faster than my angels can fly
