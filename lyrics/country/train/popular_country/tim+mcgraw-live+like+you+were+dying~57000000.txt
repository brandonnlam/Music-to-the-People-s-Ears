   He said I was in my early forties With a lot of life before me When a moment came that stopped me on a dime I spent most of the next days Looking at the x-rays Talking about the options talking 'bout sweet time And I asked him when it sank in That this might really be the real end How's it hit cha get that kind of news Man what'd you do he said I went sky diving I went rocky mountain climbing I went two point seven seconds On a bull named Fumanchu. And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter And gave forgiveness I'd been denying And he said some day I hope you get the chance To live like you were dying He said I was finally the husband That most the time I wasn't I became a friend a friend would like to have And all 'a sudden going fishin' Wasn't such an impostition And I went three time that year I lost my dad Well I finally read the good book And I took a good long hard look At what I'd do if I could do it all Again... And then I went sky diving I went rocky mountain climbing I went two point seven seconds On a bull named Fumanchu And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter And gave forgiveness I'd been denying And he said some day I hope you get the chance To live like you were dying Like tomorrow was a gift And you've got eternity to think about What you'd do with it What did you do with it What did I do with it What would I do with it I went sky divin N' I went rocky mountain climbing I went two point seven seconds On a bull named Fumanchu And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter And I watched an eagle as it was flying And he said one day I hope you get the chance To live like you were dying To live like you were dying To live like you were dying To live like you were dying To live like you were dying
