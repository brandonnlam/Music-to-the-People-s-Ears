   Snap backs and Levi jeans Pbr and burnt cds Running for the grass on the hot concrete Still working on our summer feet Cheap gas and ready ice Trunk music and headlight fights Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire A pretty girl and a pickup line like "Hey what's your name you know smoke follows beauty baby We stayed up all night long Made our drinks too strong Feeling ten feet tall Ropes swinging into the water In the middle of the night Like oh-oh-oh oh oh Breaking our boots in Stomping on the ground we grew up on Yeah we were raised on it Worked hard and played on it We had it made on it We were born and raised on it Car wash at the custom tent Sticky quarters and pine tree scent The only sign that we ever got stuck Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck 5-1's with a 20 on top Three guard at the barber shop Ducking from your ex at the 4-way stop Turn the music down when you're passing the cops We stayed up all night long Made our drinks too strong Feeling ten feet tall Ropes swinging into the water In the middle of the night Like oh-oh-oh oh oh Breaking our boots in Stomping on the ground we grew up on Yeah we were raised on it Worked hard and played on it We had it made on it We were born and raised on it Mama's prayers and daddy's speech Front porch philosophies A little too young and dumb to see Just what it all meant to me We stayed up all night long Made our drinks too strong Feeling ten feet tall Ropes swinging into the water In the middle of the night Like oh-oh-oh oh oh Breaking our boots in Stomping on the ground we grew up on Yeah we were raised on it Worked hard and played on it We had it made on it We were born and raised on it Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
