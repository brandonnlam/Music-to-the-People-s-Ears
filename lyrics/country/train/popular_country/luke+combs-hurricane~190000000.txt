   Hadn't had a good time Since you know when Got talked into goin' out With hopes you were stayin' in I was feeling like myself for the first time In a long time 'Till I bumped into some of your friends Over there talkin' to mine Then you roll in with your hair in the wind Baby without warning I was doin' alright but just your sight Had my heart stormin' The moon went hiding Stars quit shining Rain was dropping Thunder 'n lightning You wrecked my whole world when you came And hit me like a hurricane You hit me like a hurricane Knew it was gonna be a long night From the moment when We locked eyes over whiskey on ice Talkin' 'bout us again If I woulda just layed my drink down And walked out I wouldn't be in my truck Driving us to your house But you rolled in with your hair in the wind Baby without warning I was doin alright but just your sight Had my heart stormin' The moon went hiding Stars quit shining Rain was dropping Thunder 'n lightning You wrecked my whole world when you came And hit me like a hurricane You hit me like a hurricane Yeah we go to five With your smile blew me away And girl it ain't but midnight She gon' kill the lights Bring my heart back to your bedside Then you roll in with your hair in the wind Baby without warning I was doin' alright but just your sight Had my heart stormin' The moon went hiding Stars quit shining Rain was dropping Thunder 'n lightning You wrecked my whole world when you came And hit me like a hurricane You hit me like a hurricane Hit me like a hurricane
