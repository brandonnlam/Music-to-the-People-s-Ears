   Here she comes two hours late But that girls always worth the wait Yea and I love it She's got a tiny shirt on wrong side out She makes left to center seem right somehow Oooooh and I love it She's got a way of being nonchalant Kinda quirky everything I'm not Chorus She's so un-ordinary So unpredictable it's scary And I think I've got more than what I bargained for But I keep coming back for more of it 'cause I love it She's got two tattoos One's on her back And I ain't sayin where the other ones at Yea but I love it She don't own a dress But she's a beauty queen Takes glamor shots in cut off jeans And I love it But if there's one thing that I love the most Its how she does exactly what I think she won't Chorus x2
