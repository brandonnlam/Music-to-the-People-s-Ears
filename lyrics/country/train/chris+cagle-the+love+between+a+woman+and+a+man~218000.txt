   Chris Cagle/Kenny Mims Way Back home where the cypress grew In a clapboard shack on the black bayou Live a woman and a man that I call Mom and Dad And Times were hard and times were tough We barely had nothing' but we didn't need much Except for the love of a woman and a man Daddy worked his fingers to the bone But I know my mamma was the reason he was strong Everybody knows if the cold wind blows The seeds don't sprout and the crops won't grow Even though you've done the best you can And when you're livin in a house that u don't own And the money in the bank is almost gone The only thing in life I know that stands Is the love between a woman and a man Well I grew up workin like my daddy did Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in But it wasn't enough and I did not understand You see the only thing that matters money can't buy And when it gets down the bottom line It's the love you find between a woman and a man Everything Daddy said to me was true 'Cause my life was not complete until I found you Everybody knows if the cold wind blows The seeds don't sprout and the crops won't grow Even though you've done the best you can And when you're livin in a house that u don't own And the money in the bank is almost gone The only thing in life I know that stands Is the love between a woman and a man Everybody knows if the cold wind blows The seeds don't sprout and the crops won't grow Ooohhh And when you're livin in a house that u don't own And the money in the bank is almost gone The only thing in life I know that stands Is the love between a woman and a man The only thing in life I know that stands Is the love between a woman and a man
