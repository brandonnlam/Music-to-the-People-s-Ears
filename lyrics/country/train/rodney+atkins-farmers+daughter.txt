   Well I heard he needed some help on the farm Somebody with a truck n' two strong arms Not scared of dirt n' willin' to work 'til the sun goes down So I pulled up n' said I'm your man I can start right now n' we shook hands He said the fence needs fixin' The peaches need pickin' n' The cows need bringin' round I was haulin' hay I was feedin' the hogs n' that Summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog so I cooled off in the creek. Then it was back to work in that daggum' heat I was cussin' out loud thinkin' bout' quittin' But lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't. 'Cuz just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter I caught a glimpse of the farmer's daughter. She was just getting home from Panama City All tanned-up and my kinda pretty When her eyes met mine I was thinkin that I sure love my job As the days got shorter our talks got longer The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger. So we'd hop in the truck n' get all tangled up every chance we got. We were down by the river all night long n' When the sun came up I was sneakin her home And dragin my butt to work With the smell of her perfume on my shirt. I was haulin hay I was feedin the hogs N' that summer sun's got me sweatin like a dog So I cooled off in the creek then it was back to work in that daggum heat I was cussin' out thinkin bout quitin Lookin back now I'm sure glad I didn't Cuz just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter I fell in love in love with the farmer's daughter We got married last spring and there ain't no better life for me I'd be haulin hay I'd be feedin the hogs And that summer sun's got me sweatin' like a dog So I'd cool off in the creek And she'd bring me out a glass of sweet iced tea I'd be on my tractor she'd be on my mind and I can't wait till it's quitin time Cuz just when I think it can't get no hotter I come home to the farmer's daughter
