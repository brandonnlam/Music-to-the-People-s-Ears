   People say I'm a crazy son of a gun 'Cause I've made me a couple million never saved a one I don't ever buy green bananas Don't believe I'll ever leave Savannah I don't worry about tomorrow until it comes Chorus I'm just living in the here and now High on life getting by somehow Laughing and talking and drinking it up I ain 't got enough time for thinkin' too much Today's another beautiful day I got the wind in my hair the sun on my face Tomorrow can't bring me down Cause I'm living in the here and now My pickup runs like a top and it's ten years old My boots fit just like a glove and my beer is cold My friends all love me just the way that I am They're cool with the fact that I don't give a damn Next week next month next year hell who knows Chorus I'm just living in the here and now High on life getting by somehow Laughing and talking and drinking it up I ain 't got enough time for thinkin' too much Today's another beautiful day I got the wind in my hair the sun on my face Tomorrow can't bring me down Cause I'm living in the here and now Today's another beautiful day I got the wind in my hair the sun on my face Tomorrow can't bring me down Cause I'm living in the here and now
