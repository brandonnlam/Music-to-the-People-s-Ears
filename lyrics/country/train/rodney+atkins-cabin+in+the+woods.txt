   I know the guy that owns the key to the lock on the chain of that gate Across that gravel road that winds back into the trees. You'd never know just over that hill there's a little log house by a spring Fed creek where the blue bells grow so thick you wouldn't believe. And he said it would be ok if we wanted to use it for a weekend getaway. Oh I wanna lay down with you In a cabin in the woods. On an old feather bed. With the fire goin good. Just the two of us alone Feelin like we should. I wanna lay down with you In a cabin in the woods. We can sit on the porch and soak up the moon light or if it gets cold we Can go inside and light a candle or two and open up some wine. And if we get lucky it'll start to rain on that old tin roof don't you love That sound that will get you all relaxed and freeze your mind. Come on baby lets go right now. I can't wait to get you where there's no one else around. Oh I wanna lay down with you In a cabin in the woods. On an old feather bed. With the fire goin good. Just the two of us alone Feelin like we should. I wanna lay down with you In a cabin in the woods. I wanna hold you and listen to the crickets sing. And a coyote howlin at the midnight train While were doin our thing. Yeah I wanna lay down with you In a cabin in the woods. On an old feather bed. With the fire goin good. Just the two of us alone Feelin like we should. I wanna lay down with you In a cabin in the woods. I wanna lay down with you In a cabin in the woods. Baby I know the guy that owns the key to the lock on the chain of that gate Across that gravel road that winds back into the trees.
