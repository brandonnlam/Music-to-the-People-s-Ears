   She said 'I've been up all night and half-scared to death I can smell the liquor on your breath I paid for your rehab with my IRA Boy your daddy's be turning in his grave.' She said 'son I've done all mama can do I can save myself but I can't save you.' He said 'I wished you and Jesus would get off my back.' They said his truck was doing ninety when he crashed I bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes Even God cries when an angel's hands are tied They said 'honey grown-ups do this all the time.' And tears welled up in their little girl's eyes They said 'now it's not something that you've done It just that mommy and daddy don't get along.' She said 'do you guys mean that you need a time out And that daddy's gonna move to a different house?' They said 'you'll have two bedrooms you're a lucky kid.' She said 'what about Checkers where's he gonna live?' I bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes Even God cries when an angel's hands are tied She prays 'angels watch me through the night Stay by my side till morning light God bless mama god bless daddy Keep us together and happy.' I bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes Even God cries when an angel's hands are tied
