I've got a weekend full of nothin' to do at all: Yee Haw I know a place down the road The girls are hot the beer is cold. It's two-for-one yeah that's right: Not just drinks it's girls to guys. I hear the twins are back in town from Saginaw: Yee Haw You take your all-right you take your can't-wait. A lotta of bring-it-on an' some damn straight An' mix it all up with some down home southern drawl y'all: You got your yee haw The place is packed the line is long The band know every Haggard song.

A lotta of bring-it-on an' some damn straight An' mix it all up with some down home southern drawl y'all: You got your yee haw!.
