   Darryl Worley/Leslie I'd like to lay this old hammer down Drive my pickup truck to town Find a friend and just hang around If I could just be me Grab a bobber and my old cane pole Spend a evenin' at the fishin' hole Why I wouldn't hurt a soul If I could just be me I've learned to live behind these fences But I'm not the kind of man to just go along Now and then I need a chance to be who I am Maybe sing a different song I need to put my worries on a shelf Take some time to get to know myself I wouldn't have to be nobody else If I could just be me I've learned to live behind these fences But I'm not the kind of man to just go along Now and then I need a chance to be who I am Maybe sing a different song If I didn't have these bills to pay If I could really have my way I'd lay around and love on you all day If I could just be me If I didn't have these bills to pay If I could just be me If I could just be me If I could just be me
