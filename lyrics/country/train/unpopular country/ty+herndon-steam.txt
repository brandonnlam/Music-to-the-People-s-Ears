   Steam from a summer rain drop Rising off the blacktop I wipe the sweat from my brow Steam from my radiator I'm late and getting later Should be at your place by now Bank sign says a hundred and two But that ain't nothin' when I'm next to you Chorus There's fire in your fingertips Flames in your touch Desire in your burnin' lips I can't get enough Today was a scorcher But I'll go you one better Tonite when we get together We're going to make steam I dream of you there on my front steps Sunnin in that short dress Hotter than the the Texas heat Seems I'm never gonna get there Traffic's going no where But when I feel you next to me Girl the things that you know to do Just makes my heat index go through the roof Chorus There's fire in your fingertips Flames in your touch Desire in your burnin' lips I can't get enough Today was a scorcher But I'll go you one better Tonite when we get together We're going to make steam Chorus Girl the things that you know to do Just make my heat index go through the roof
