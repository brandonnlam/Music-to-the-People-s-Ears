   I called up the DJ On Friday after work I told him how you done me wrong And how much it hurt I said mister I got some things To get off my chest I told him what I had in mind But he turned down my request he said You can't say that on the radio I'd really like to help you out That's just the way it goes So sad and that's too bad Everybody knows You can't say that on the radio He told me he understood exactly how I felt He said boy I been in your shoes Once or twice myself I got a hundred thousand watts A runnin' through this microphone And I could let your message ring loud and clear But tomorrow I'd be gone because You can't say that on the radio I'd really like to help you out That's just the way it goes So sad and that's too bad Everybody knows You can't say that on the radio No you can't say that You can't say that on the radio
