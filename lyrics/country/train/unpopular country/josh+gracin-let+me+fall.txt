   I watched you wave good-bye As you rode down our drive Without one single tear in your eyes I tried to be strong Forced to smile said Girl go on "I'll be fine don't you worry 'bout me Inside I was holdin' on Prayin' that you might see I'm all you'll ever need How do I hurt And how do I cry And so many times you let me down Where do I turn And where do I hide With all this emptiness inside. There's no use in loving you at all So let me fall I tried to make it through the day Throwin' all those things away The ones that remind me of you Soon there'll be nothing left But the bed where you laid your head The one that I wake up in without you How do I hurt And how do I cry And so many times you let me down Where do I turn And where do I hide With all this emptiness inside. There's no use in loving you at all So let me fall How do I hurt And how do I cry And so many times you let me down Where do I turn And where do I hide With all this emptiness inside. There's no use in loving you at all There's no use in loving you at all So let me fall
