   Well Bobby's out with Susie Q And Larry's here trying to down a few cold ones Just to get her off his mind He's drinking turkey like it's water If the bar had something stronger he'd be on it In the blink of an eye Then Susie Q walked in with that boy Bobby Holding her hand And some were scared to death and some held their breath but not a person there Didn't understand It's all about love One don't one does And that's just the way it is One heart's movin' on One heart's holdin strong And one's left on the fence Gonna be a Sunday morning first light Grapevine telling lies Face to face deny What happened on Saturday night Well Larry called the waitress over Tipped her a twenty just to hold her And Susie caught it out of the corner of her eye She left Bobby there standin' At the table empty-handed as the band played Why Lady Why It's all about love One don't one does And that's just the way it is One heart's movin' on One heart's holdin strong And one's left on the fence Gonna be a Sunday morning first light Grapevine telling lies Face to face deny What happened on Saturday night Ol' Bobby's aim was true as he knocked out Larry's tooth And Susie Q startin cussin' Bobby out She told Larry that she loved him On the floor as she hugged him And the waitress bought Bobby a round She said...  It's all about love One don't one does And that's just the way it is One heart's movin' on One heart's holdin strong And one's left on the fence Gonna be a Sunday morning first light Grapevine telling lies Face to face deny What happened on Saturday...  Sunday morning first light Grapevine telling lies Face to face deny What happened on Saturday night
