   What was I thinkin' Comin' home at a quarter after three With a chip on my shoulder Lettin' whiskey speak for me Well you packed your bags and when you looked back I sat and watched you go What was I thinkin' God only knows How much I love you What I'd give for a second chance I'd swallow my pride stay by your side Never let go again And I don't know if you don't come back How I'll make it on my own What was I thinkin' God only knows What's on your mind Every time my number's on your phone Do you think about the way we were And where we went wrong When you hear my name  Does it feel the same as it did so long ago What was I thinkin' God only knows How much I love you What I'd give for a second chance I'd swallow my pride stay by your side Never let go again And I don't know if you don't come back How I'll make it on my own What was I thinkin' God only knows God only knows If I lost everything God only knows If you'll come back to me God only knows How much I love you What I'd give for a second chance I'd swallow my pride stay by your side Never let go again And I don't know if you don't come back How I'll make it on my own What was I thinkin' God only knows What was I thinkin' God only knows
