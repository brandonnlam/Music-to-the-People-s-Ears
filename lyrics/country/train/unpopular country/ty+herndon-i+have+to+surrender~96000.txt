   All Of My Life I Fought Hard For The Things I Have Wanted Caught Up In Blindly Believing The Strongest Survive But Here In Your Eyes I See Everything I Ever Dreamed Of And I Am Afraid If I Rush In If I Move In Too Fast I Just Might Frighten My One Chance Away Chorus It's Easy To Be Strong I've Done It For So Long But This Time I Have To Remember This Time To Get What I Want I Have To Surrender Here I Stand Helplessly Willing And Waiting For Your Love When Want Became Need My Heart Had No Choice At All What Will You Do Now It's Up To You Now It's So Hard To Wait But I Will God Give Me Wisdom God Give Me The Strength And The Courage To Simply Stand Still Chorus It's Easy To Be Strong I've Done It For So Long But This Time I Have To Remember This Time To Get What I Want I Have To Surrender Bridge Here I Am Take Me Somehow You Saved Me From A Lifetime Of Not Being All Love Could Make Me Chorus It's Easy To Be Strong I've Done It For So Long But This Time I Have To Remember This Time To Get What I Want This Time I Have To Be Tender This Time To Get What I Need I Have To Surrender
