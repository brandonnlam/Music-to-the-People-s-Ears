   The Montana night is still There's a coyote on the hill Howlin' at the diamond sky but no one hears There are no answers in the stars Only questions in my heart So I count mountains on the moon Through my lonely tears Countin' mountains on the moon Sleep it never comes too soon I'd climb the highest one for you Countin' mountains mountains on the moon Sometimes in perfect light Those mountain tops come into sight Almost close enough to touch Like dreams of you And if you pass this canyon dear I left an echo for you there Hopin' you'd come back again Like echoes always do Countin' mountains on the moon Sleep it never comes too soon I'd climb the highest one for you Countin' mountains mountains on the moon Countin' mountains mountains on the moon
