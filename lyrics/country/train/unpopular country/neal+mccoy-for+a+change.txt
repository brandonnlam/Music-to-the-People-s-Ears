   It seems like all my life I've never been satisfied Ain't nothin' I ain't tried Takin' every kind of line Tryin' to find my home on the range Been close a time or two To seein' that dream come true But I never could follow through Couldn't drop the other shoe 'Cause pretty soon I knew I'd be lookin' for a change For a change I can see a little sunlight Shinin' through the pourin' rain I swear it's gettin' a little brighter Every time you call my name You know I could get used to this But right now it still feels strange To be a happy man I'm talkin' 'bout a happy man I'm a happy man For a change Girl I must confess I live for your caress Every single time we kiss I know that I've been blessed I wanna share the same address And that's where I wanna remain Goodbye o' wonder lust I been there long enough Those times they sure are tough Things sure are lookin' up Ever since I found your love I ain't lookin' for a change For a change I can see a little sunlight Shinin' through the pourin' rain I swear it's gettin' a little brighter Every time you call my name You know I could get used to this A little home on the range I'm a happy man Darlin' you made me a happy man I'm a happy man For a change For a change
