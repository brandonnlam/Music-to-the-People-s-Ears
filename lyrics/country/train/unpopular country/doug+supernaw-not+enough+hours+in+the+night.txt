   Writers: Aaron Barker/Kim Williams/Rob Harbin Sometimes I wish there were no windows in this room The sun comes pouring through those curtains Way too soon Reminding me it's time to rise and shine But you look so good lying there In that old T-shirt of mine Chorus: There's not enough hours in the night Not enough time to hold you tight How time flies when you are in love We lay down and the sun comes up I wish that I could set that clock To moonlight saving time When it comes to loving you There's not enough hours in the night They say two people just can't live on love alone But girl if we die trying what a way to go I think I'll call in and say I'm running late Hang a blanket on the window And steal an hour from the day
