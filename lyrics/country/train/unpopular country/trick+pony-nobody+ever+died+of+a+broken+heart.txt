   It must've hit you like a hurricane Now you're swimmin' with a ball and chain Sweet love's gone down the drain Down down Girl you're lookin' like a walkin dead You need to drag a brush across that head The crack of noon and you're still in bed Wake up straighten up put on your makeup NO nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart You cut his head out of every picture From the letters where he said that he missed ya All his memories well you can kiss 'em Bye bye When enough is for sure enough It's time to shake it out and shake it up Get in the middle of a great big love Wham-bam thank you ma'am baby here we go again No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart No nobody nobody ever died of a broken heart
