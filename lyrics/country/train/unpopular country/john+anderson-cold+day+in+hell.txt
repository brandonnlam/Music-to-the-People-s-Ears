   Said that you'd love me forever Love me til the rivers ran dry Said that we'd be together Til the stars fell from the sky We'd love each other til hell freezes over And birds no longer fly If I'm ever gonna wish on a falling star Tonight would be a good time to try I guess we're gonna run outta water I can't find a bird in the sky What never should happen is happening now I just heard you tell me goodbye Don't need to see anybody/feeling too empty inside The worlds going crazy/I'm feeling shakey I just need a good place to hide I should have known better when you said you'd never Hurt me or tell me a lie Guess I'd better break out my old winter coat It's sure getting cold for July I guess we're gonna run outta water I can't find a bird in the sky What never should happen is happening now I just heard you tell me goodbye If you are watching wherever you are At the last of the stars as the fell It's a cold day a cold day a cold day in hell
