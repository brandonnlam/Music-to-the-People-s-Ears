   Sometimes I think that I can make it But most days well I get by on faking 'Cause I wont let them see me cry So I hold my tears inside Late at night your name is calling And usually what gets you there comes running But there's no way you can now I wish there was a way somehow So I will remember you And I will hold you close there in my heart and never let you go And there'll be days when I will cry But no I wont No I can't say good bye Lord tell me how is this fair When in his eyes I see your memory there Oh and the promises that we made Get erased with yesterday So I will remember you And I will hold you close there in my heart and never let you go And there'll be days when I will cry But no I wont No I can't say goodbye So I will remember you And I will hold you close there in my heart and never let you go ... And there'll be days when I will cry But no I wont Oh no I can't No I wont No I can't... Say goodbye.
