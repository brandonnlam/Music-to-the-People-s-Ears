   I love the way your hair lays on your shoulders And how it shines there in the light I wanna hold 'cha so come a little closer I don't want to miss a thing tonight Baby leave the light on I wanna see how beatiful you are Baby leave the light on I don't wanna be blinded by the dark I wanna look inside your lovin eyes And watch you when you breath Leave the light on when you're makin love to me I love your face Girl you're so pretty I love your skin it feels so soft And I locve that look That tells me your ready As you let me take your nightgown off Baby leave the light on I wanna see how beatiful you are Baby leave the light on I don't wanna be blinded by the dark I wanna look inside your lovin eyes And watch you when you breath Leave the light on when you're makin love to me Baby leave the light on I wanna look inside your lovin eyes And watch you when you breath Baby leave the light on When you're makin love to me
