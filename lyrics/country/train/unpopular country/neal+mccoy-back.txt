   Love I know that I did you bad and badder Must have been insane as an old mad hatter then But pride is a fairy tale sweet darlin' Lonely is a cold hard fact I don't want to know like without your kiss All I really want it back Words Words that I said in a heated moment Still can't believe that I said I wanted out After all the times that I spent wishing I'd just shut my trap You'd think that I could find those precious few words That'll bring you back I don't want to know what tomorrow holds baby Nothing gonna come of that Everything I need is behind me lately Don't you know it's fading fast fast Baby won't you take me back  Time Time that we had was a priceless treasure Gone like a junk mail letter I threw out I don't want to think about the future 'Cause anything that's in my path Wouldn't be as good as this I know If I could only just go back I don't want to break your heart sweet darlin' I know you've had enough of that I don't want to know life without your kiss All I really want is back
