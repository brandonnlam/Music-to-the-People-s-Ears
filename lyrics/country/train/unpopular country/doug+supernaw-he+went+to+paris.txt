   Writer: Jimmy Buffett He went to Paris looking for answers to the questions that bothered him so He was impressive young and aggressive saving the world on his own The warm summer breezes and French wine and cheeses Put his ambitions at bay Summers and Winters scattered like splinters and 4 to 5 years slipped away He went to England played the piano and married an actress named Kim They had a good life she was a fine wife and bore him a young son named Jim All of the answers to most of the questions locked in his attic some day But he liked the quiet clean country living and 20 more years skipped away Solo: The war took his baby the bombs killed his lady and left him with only one eye His body was battered his whole world was shattered and All he could do was just cry While the tears were falling he was recalling the answers that he never found Hopped on a freighter skated the ocean and left England without a sound Now he lives in the islands fishes the pilings and drinking his Green label each day Writing his memoirs losing his hearing but he don't care what most people say After 86 years of perpetual motion if he likes you he'll smile and say Some of it's magic some of it's tragic but I had a good life all the way He went to Paris looking for answers to the questions that bothered him so
