   Some lives roll hard grow weary and old Along lonely nights down unfriendly roads They twist and turn and lead us astray I know because I've rolled that way So broken hearted then a miracle started Something moving in me Something moving so powerfully I can almost hear it Touching my spirit so tenderly Your love is something moving in me I used to lean on unreliable friends And false promises the nights without end I never learned how how good it could be To have someone like you leaning on me Now I rejoice in How the sound of your voice can start Something moving in me Something moving so powerfully I can almost hear it Touching my spirit so tenderly Your love is something moving in me Your love is something moving in me Something moving in me Something moving so powerfully I can almost hear it Touching my spirit so tenderly Your love is something moving in me
