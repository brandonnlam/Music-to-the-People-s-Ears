   Chorus: Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem She's always on my mind Her memory goes round and round I've tried to quit a thousand times Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem Fill the glass up to the top I'll start with livin' her But I don't know when to stop I wake up and right away Her name is on my lips Once the memories start to flow I can't stop with just one sip Chorus I keep on remembering How good it used to be Gettin' stoned all alone On my favorite memory Chorus I ll start with lovin' you But I don't know when to stop
