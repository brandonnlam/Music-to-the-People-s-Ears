   Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die I met her accidentally in St. Paul Minnesota And it tore me up ev'ry time I heard her drawl Southern Drawl Then I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin' in Davenport And I followed you Big River when you called Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river A freighter said she's been here but she's gone boy she's gone I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the bluff She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone Well I pulled into Natchez next day down the river But there wasn't that much to make a rounder stay very long But when I left it was rainin' so nobody saw me cry Big River why you doin' me this way Now won't you batter down by Baton Rouge River Queen Roll it on Take that woman on down to New Orleans New Orleans Go on I've had enough dump my blues down in the gulf She loves you Big River more than me
