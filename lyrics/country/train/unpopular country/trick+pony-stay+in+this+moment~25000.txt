   Before you must leave This evening this hour And the rush of this moment is through I want to tell you How good it felt to Completely surrender to you Feeling you close Right here besides me Almost suspended in time I don't want to move I don't want to let go I don't want to leave this behind Honey stay in my arms Stay in this cradle And rock me to sleep Tell me you're able To make time stand still And there's nowhere you've got to be Stay in this moment with me The wind through the window The words that we whisper A touch only true love can claim As long as the moonlight chases the shadows There's nothing that I want to change Honey stay in my arms Stay in this cradle And rock me to sleep Tell me you're able To make time stand still And there's nowhere you've got to be Honey stay in my arms Stay in this cradle And rock me to sleep Tell me you're able To make time stand still And there's nowhere you've got to be
