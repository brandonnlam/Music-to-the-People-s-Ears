   Well I made my plans To leave you far behind. To put you in my past And get you off my mind. So I took your memory On a midnight ride. Down a dark and lonely back road And left it there to die. But look what followed me home I thought I was alone. But your memory It's coming back to me. I thought I left it behind And had you off my mind. But I see I was wrong wrong wrong Look what followed me home. Well I walked down to the river At the break of dawn. With a picture of you darlin' Up underneath my arm. I said the heartaches over Today is your last day. And I thanked that muddy river As it carried you away. But look what followed me home I thought I was alone. But your memory It's coming back to me. I thought I left it behind Got you off my mind. But I see I was wrong wrong wrong Look what followed me home. Yeah I see I was wrong wrong wrong Look what follwed me home.
