   There's nothing like that morning coffee in bed A big ol' pillow propped behind my head Watching you stretch like a calico cat No it don't get much better than that I love to hear you tell me what you dreamed I love to hear you tell me everything Wearing nothing but my T-shirt and your sleepy smile You know that look never goes out of style We're right on time right where we need to be We've got each other and that's enough Come rain or shine we always seem to be Spending every minute in love We'll take the telephone off the hook Close the cover on that appointment book While the lazy ol' sun falls from the sky Love will be falling on you and I We're right on time right where we need to be We've got each other and that's enough Come rain or shine we always seem to be Spending every minute in love Sixty seconds to a minute Sixty minutes to an hour There's twenty-four of 'em in it That's a lot of love power Oh we're right on time right where we need to be We've got each other and that's enough Come rain or shine we always seem to be Spending every minute in love Spending every minute in love
