   Storm clouds storm clouds Used to dog me everywhere I'd go Time was I was running from them Down these dusty roads Somehow those clouds drove me to your door And Honey I'm not running anymore Well I used to curse the thunder I used to run for cover when it came But since I let it strike me I never looked at lightening quite the same Now I pray for rain Sunshine sunshine Won't you go and come another day Give my love and I a reason to stay in and play Oh while the full winds seem so gloomy without you But holding her has changed my point of view Well I used to curse the thunder I used to run for cover when it came But since I let it strike me I never looked at lightening quite the same Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Well I used to curse the thunder I used to run for cover when it came But since I let it strike me I never looked at lightening quite the same Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain Now I pray for rain
