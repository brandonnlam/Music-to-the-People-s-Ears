   On the day that he was born a proud dad took him home Wrapped in dreams that reached to the sky Said You're the only one I'll ever call son And I'll call you son because you shine By the time he turned 18 He'd been  everything A leader in church and in school Yeah the old man had been blessed Because on every list the boy was Voted the Most likely to Chorus Now there's a monkey on his back And it's leavin it's tracks On arms that were once muscle bound Yeah the old man sits on his front porch everday Watching his son going down Watching his son going down Nine years old shootin basketball goals Now his goals just aren't the same But when you've got to get high just to survive Scoring's still the name of the game From a pepsi and a Baby Ruth To pills and 90 proof And his coke is not the carbinated kind Cause the old mans not forgotten His only begotten He says I just call you son now Bacause your mine Repeat chorus Yeah the horse he rode away Didn't live on oats and hay But still he rode that horse into the ground Now the old man stands with flowers all round Watchin his son going down Watchin his son going down
