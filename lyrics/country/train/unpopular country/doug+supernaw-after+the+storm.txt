   Writers: Doug Supernaw/Justin White/Allen Huff They're about to turn the lights out The car just gave out there goes this month's check Seems like everything we own is either falling down or standing up on it's last leg Somehow like before we'll find a way to make ends meet Beat the wolves off the door and get back on our feet Cause we've ridden out some bad ones just by holdin' on To the one thing we knew would still be standing strong Our love will be here long after the storm is gone We were about to lose the light house Getting tossed about on a sea of debt Seems like every time we bailed the boat we'd spring a leak But patch it up before we got wet With one eye always looking out to find a better wind We've drifted out but somehow always drifted back again Chorus: And we've ridden out some bad ones just by holdin' on To the one thing we knew would still be standing strong Our love will be here long after the storm is gone
