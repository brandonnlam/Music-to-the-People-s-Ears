But he said You got talent,to use it you would". With brand new confidence And a heart full of thanks Just a little while latter No more of I can't". I called up the folks And poured my heart out. I was sorry I had Caused them so much hurt and  to doubt. I told them how sorry I was That I had cheated and stole. What a surprize I got Kenny Beard treated me like gold. He welcomed me back into his home. Gave me that cherished guitar. Treated me better Then I'd ever dreamed that he would by far. Broken promises Broken dreams No longer my demise Out law moves No longer my diguise My cry for help From heaven had been heard. The Lord will help If you ask Like it says In his Word.
