   There's some left over wine in the cupboard About a half a glass left for the road Here's a toast to the time we were lovers-then I'll go Should I laugh or should I cry Love you hate you live or die Chorus: Is my heart half full or half empty Is our love like the wine in this glass You drink like there's no tomorrow So sure it would always last Will the memories tase sweet as they linger Or the bitterness stay on my tongue Is my heart half full of the love you gave me Or my heart half empty cuz your love is gone Your bags are all packed in the hallway The boxes are stacked on the lawn You kissed me goodbye just like always And you're gone Trembling hands or nerves of steel Someone tell me what to feel Chorus
