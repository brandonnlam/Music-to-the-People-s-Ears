   Songwriter: Mize Logan They say don't drink the water South of border towns That sun keeps getting hotter And I need somethin' to cool me down So I found a cantina On the edge of a white sandy beach Now I'm drinking margaritas And it's not even three I'm livin' in a mexicoma Smellin' that tequilaroma I'm don't think I'm ever gonna Make it back home Hypnotized by the salt in the air Senoritas with long dark hair Reality's callin' but I don't care I'm livin' in a mexicoma I've got sand in my bottle And I've got sand on my lime I've got sand in my pockets And I've got sand where the sun don't shine Yo no tengo dinero Se no que ma de resles so I'm not sure when I learned how To speak espanol I'm livin' in a mexicoma Smellin' that tequilaroma I'm don't think I'm ever gonna Make it back home Hypnotized by the salt in the air Senoritas with long dark hair Reality's callin' but I don't care I'm livin' in a mexicoma La la la la la La la la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la I'm livin' in a mexicoma Smellin' that tequilaroma I'm don't think I'm ever gonna Make it back home Hypnotized by the salt in the air Senoritas with long dark hair Reality's callin' but I don't care I'm livin' in a mexicoma
