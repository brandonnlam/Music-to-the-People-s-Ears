   I've never felt like this before I wanna feel like this some more How did you do what no one's done Chances were a million to one I betcha can't do that again Move me like you did just then Make me wanna spend the rest of my life Here in your arms I betcha can't take away my breath Leave me with no resistance left See if you can I betcha can't do that again I'm at the mercy of your touch I never wanted anyone so much But can you do that one more time I'd really love to see you try I Betcha can't do that again Move me like you did just then Make me wanna spend the rest of my life Here in your arms I betcha can't take away my breath Leave me with no resistance left See if you can I betcha can't do that again See if you can I betcha can't do that again
