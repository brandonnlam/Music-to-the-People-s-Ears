   Hey baby I guess you're wonderin' what I'm doing home so soon. Naw I ain't sick. It's just this morning when you told me you didn't feel like you were the most important thing in my life anymore Well that broke my heart. So I had to turn around and come back an' tell you what I'm gonna do about it. I'm gonna light the bedroom candles Take the phone out of the wall. We can lay around and talk for hours Or maybe we won't talk at all. I'm gonna resurrect the love That slipped away from us An' the man you've been missin'. Startin' with some long slow kisses. I just wanna let you know how ashamed I am for making you feel that way. Darlin' I'm so sorry. I guess I've just been focussin' too much time on makin' a livin' Way too little on makin' love. But if you can find it in your heart to forgive me girl I swear from this moment on You'll always know where you stand with me. I'm gonna light the bedroom candles Take the phone out of the wall. We can lay around and talk for hours Or maybe we won't talk at all. I'm gonna resurrect the love That slipped away from us An' the man you've been missin'. Startin' with some long slow kisses. 'Cause what really matters most Is you and me this close Feeling no distance: An sharin' some long slow kisses. Sharin' some long slow kisses.
