   Baby just lay there don't you move. And I will lay right here watchin' you. I wonder if you know how much I love just Having you in my life. Chorus: 'Cuz you're my favorite thing to hold When the world is running 'round. You're my favorite place to hide When the rain is pourin' down. And I wish that I could find the perfect verse The perfect rhyme but I guess all I'm sayin' Is anyway you say it baby you're my favorite. Just a minute more that's all I asked. I want to picture you looking just like that. T-Shirt and hair down no makeup on. Girl I'm constantly amazed How beautiful you are... Chorus: 'Cuz you're my favorite thing to hold When the world is running 'round. You're my favorite place to hide When the rain is pourin' down. And I wish that I could find the perfect verse The perfect rhyme but I guess all I'm sayin' Is anyway you say it baby you're my favorite. Oh baby there ain't no doubt about it... 'Cuz you're my favorite thing to hold When the world is running 'round. You're my favorite place to hide When the rain is pourin' down. And I wish that I could find the perfect verse The perfect rhyme but I guess all I'm really sayin' Is I love you so much baby And anyway you say it baby you're my favorite.
