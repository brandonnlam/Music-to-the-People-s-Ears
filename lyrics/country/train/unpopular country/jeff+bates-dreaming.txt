   Last night as I lay dreaming I saw you dear And tears came streaming It seemed like old times When we were so in love And life was like a rhyme Chorus---Oh how I miss you darling Oh how I miss your cheer And I miss you still- Even thou it has been years. I still long to hear your voice And hear you whisper in my ear. I still long for you to hold me tight And lie beside me every night. I could see all our favorite places Oh how I long to go again. And all our friends were there Just like they had been back then. It all seemed so real- But when I awoke nothing mattered My dream was shattered. I was all alone my darling And you were gone.
