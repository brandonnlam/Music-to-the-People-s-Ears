   Baby come take look at this dusty yearbook Do you remember those two kids It's you and me most likely to succeed Had it all planned out yes we did You were off to college gonna practice law And I was gonna play football But we threw it all away that's what the whole town had to say Momma cried daddy went for a drive and the whole world changed Not a clue what to do so I just kept on loving you On the day that we threw it all away The fall came and went and so did are friends Of doing all the things we thought we would It was tough I know but we never let go Kept holdin' onto prayers we thought we could And then that morning in December baby Don' you remember When we threw it all away that's what the whole town had to say With your baby blue eyes our baby boy cried and the whole world changed Not a clue what to do so I just kept on loving you On the day that we threw it all away Ain't it funny how life works out sometimes just like we planned You make all the rules in this house And I'm quarterbacking for our little man You were off to college gonna practice law And I was gonna play football But we threw it all away that's what the whole town had to say Momma cried daddy went for a drive and the whole world changed Not a clue what to do so I just kept on loving you On the day that we threw it all God bless the day we threw it all away Yeah we threw it all away
