   If heaven was an Hour it would be twilight When the fireflies start their dancin' on the lawn And supper's on the stove and mama's laughin' And everybody's working day is done If heaven was a town it would be my town Oh on a summer day in 1985 And everything I wanted was out there waitin' And everyone I loved was still alive Chorus: Don't cry a tear for me now baby There comes a time we all must say goodbye And if that's what heaven's made of You know I I ain't afraid to die If heaven was a pie it would be cherry So cool and sweet and heavy on the tongue And just one bite would satisfy your hunger And there'd always be enough for everyone If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one That could take this weary traveler 'round the bend If heaven was a tear it'd be my last one And you'd be in my arms again Chorus: Don't cry a tear for me now baby There comes a time we all must say goodbye And if that's what heaven's made of You know I I ain't afraid to die Yeah if that's what heaven's made of You know I I ain't afraid to die.
