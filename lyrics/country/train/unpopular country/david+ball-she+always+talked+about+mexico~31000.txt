   David Ball/Wood Newton She blew into this old one horse town Like something we ain't never seen Old Bill hired her at the Sundown Grill She tied that apron 'round her jeans I started hanging out there every night Just to hear her talk and laugh I couldn't help but fall in love with her I should've known it wouldn't last She always talked about Mexico I never thought that she would really go I thought my love could make her settle down I guess I know better now She's probably living down there by the sea I wonder if she ever thinks of me One morning she was gone like the wind She won't be back this way again Old Bill could tell that I was missing her As he poured me a drink Said if you put a wild bird in a cage You'll break it's will to sing If that's true then she's better off Still out there wild and free So I bought straight tequila all around Said Boy,here's to her memory She always talked about Mexico I never thought that she would really go I thought my love could make her settle down I guess I know better now She's probably living down there by the sea I wonder if she ever thinks of me One morning she was gone like the wind She won't be back this way again
