   I know my back can bend and bear the weight And these two hands of mine...they never shake At least not up til now So many heartbeats and it's never missed But I'm not sure if I can handle this I guess I'll find out Oh I guess I'll find out Chorus How much can one man love you How much can one man care How much can one man need you How much do I dare I know my eyes can see for miles and miles My legs can walk a good long while That's never been in doubt I always keep my passions locked away So what will happen now is hard to say Once I let them out Oh I guess I'll find out Repeat Chorus Bridge If I never let you go Maybe then I'll know Repeat Chorus
