   Randy Newman Baby take off your coat Real slow Take off your shoes I'll take off your shoes Baby take off your dress Yes yes yes You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on Go over there Turn on the light All the lights Come over here Stand on that chair Yeah that's right Raise your arms in the air Now shake 'em You give me reason to live You give me reason to live You give me reason to live You give me reason to live You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on Suspicious minds keep talkin They try to tear us apart They don't believe in this love of ours They don't know what love is They don't know what love is They don't know what love is But I know what love is You can leave your hat on You can leave your hat on...
