   This time I wonder what it feels like To find the one in this life The one we all dream of But dreams just aren't enough So I'll be waiting on the real thing I'll know it by the feeling This moment when we're meeting We'll play out like a scene Straight off the silver screen So I'll be holding my breath Can this be the end Is it that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there And everyone wants to feel like someone cares Someone to love with my life in their hands There's gotta be somebody for me like that 'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own And everyone wants to know they're not alone Somebody else that feels the same somewhere There's gotta be somebody for me out there Tonight out in the street out in the moonlight And this is feeling so right It's just like deja vu Me standing here with you So I'll be holding my breath Can this be the end Is it that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there And everyone wants to feel like someone cares Someone to love with my life in their hands There's gotta be somebody for me like that 'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own And everyone wants to know they're not alone Somebody else that feels the same somewhere There's gotta be somebody for me out there You can't give up on what you're looking for A diamond in the rough Because you never know If it shows up make sure you're holdin' on 'Cause this could be the one  The one you're waiting on 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there And everyone wants to feel like someone cares Someone to love with my life in their hands There's gotta be somebody for me  'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own And everyone wants to know they're not alone Somebody else that feels the same somewhere There's gotta be somebody for me out there
