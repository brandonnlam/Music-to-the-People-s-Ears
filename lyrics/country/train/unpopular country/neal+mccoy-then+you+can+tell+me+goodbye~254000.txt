   Kiss me each morning for a million years Hold me each evening by your side Tell me you love me for a million years Then if it don't work out If it don't work out Then you can tell me goodbye Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss Soften my dreams with your sigh Tell me you love me for a million years Then if it don't work out If it don't work out Then you can tell me goodbye If it don't work out If it don't work out Then you can tell me goodbye If you must go I won't grieve If you wait a lifetime Before you leave But if you must go I won't tell you no Just so that we can say we tried Tell me you love me for a million years Then if it don't work out If it don't work out Then you can tell me goodbye
