   There ain't nothin' like the water When you're dying of thirst Nothin' like a kiss When you're gettin' your first Nothin' like an hour When you run outta time Nothin' like the love of that woman of mine There ain't nothin' like a sign When you're searchin' for home Nothin' like a call When you're feelin' alone Nothin' like a friend On the end of the line Nothin' like the love of that woman of mine In my darkest night She is my guiding light I know when she holds me tight We'll go on forever In my darkest night She is my guiding light I know when she holds me tight We'll go on forever There ain't nothin' like a spark When you're startin' a flame Nothin' like a voice When it's callin' your name Nothin' like the moon When it shines in her eyes Nothin' like the love of that woman of mine There ain't nothin' like the love Of that woman of mine Oh nothin' like the love Of that woman of mine There ain't nothin' like the love Of that woman of mine Hmmm nothin' like that Nothin' like that woman of mine
