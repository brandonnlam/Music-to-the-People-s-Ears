   Sail on down the line About half a mile or so And I don't really wanna know ah Where you're going Maybe once or twice you see Time after time I tried Hold on to what we got But now you're going And I don't mind About the things you're gonna say Lord I gave all my money and my time I know it's a shame But I'm giving you back your name Guess I'll be on my way I won't be back to stay I guess I'll move along I'm looking for a good time Sail on down the line Ain't it funny how the time can go All my friends say they told me so But it doesn't matter It was plain to see That a small town boy like me Just I wasn't your cup of tea I was wishful thinking I gave you my heart And I tried to make you happy And you gave me nothing in return You know it ain't so hard to say Would you please just go away I've thrown away the blues I'm tired of being used I want everyone to know I'm looking for a good time Good time Sail on honey Good times never felt so good Sail on honey Good times never felt so good Sail on sugar Good times never felt so good Sail on
