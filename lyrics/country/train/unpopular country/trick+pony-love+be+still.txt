   Lyin' here tonight with you here by my side God I wish that this could last forever But the plain and honest truth Is I can't get inough of you"And I am not complete 'til we're together Stay right here Just relax Lets get lost Just lay back And let it all slip away Slowly watch The night roll into day Let two hearts in love"Go where they will Time may fly but love be still These are busy times things are movin' fast So hold me now and kiss me soft and tender Well I could not ask for more Just lock the world outside our door As our bodies become one and we surrender Stay right here Just relax Lets get lost Just lay back And let it all slip away Slowly watch The night roll into day Let two hearts in love"Go where they will Time may fly but love be still The clock up on the wall keeps tickin' And it always will But here with you we have the power To let our love be still Stay right here Just relax Lets get lost Just lay back And let it all slip away Slowly watch The night roll into day Let two hearts in love"Go where they will Time may fly but love be still
