   Writers: Buck Moore/Michelle Ray The note was short but Lord so strong It simply said I can't go on And live a lie with someone I don't love She couldn't tell me face to face Oh but how my world was changed By the hand that held the pen That wrote the words that broke the heart Of the one the one that really loves her My tears fell down like falling rain But they can't wash away the pain How will I go to sleep without her in my arms She never meant to break my heart But how my world was torn apart By the hand that held the pen That wrote the words that broke the heart Of this one the only one that really loves her With one stroke of the pen she wrote off all my dreams Erasing all the plans we made together I am the one that is to blame Oh but how my world was changed By the hand that held the pen That wrote the words that broke the heart Oh the one the only one that really loves her
