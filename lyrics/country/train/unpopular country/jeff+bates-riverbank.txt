   If there was ever a morning when the fish migh bite it'll be right now Any other time we'd done had our lines cast out Sippin on a jug of mama's sweet iced tea Catchin them 'ol cat Why couldn't today be like that I wish this was a riverbank Instead of a graveyard I wish we were sittin and fishin and this wouldn't be so hard It was my favorite thing that we used to do but now we can't I wish you were here and I wish this were a riverbank Remember the day when I baited my hook with a chunk of ham I got a big bite and he yanked the pole right outta my hand Well you jumped up and you grabbed the net and we both jumped in Yeah we got wet oh but we got him Man I wish this was a riverbank Instead of a graveyard I wish we were sittin and fishin and this wouldn't be so hard It was my favorite thing that we used to do but now we can't I wish you were here and I wish this were a riverbank I know you wouldn't want me sittin 'round and bein' sad You taught me better than that So I'm leavin' now gonna head on out And try to catch a few and while I'm there I'll cast a line for you Man I wish this was a riverbank Instead of a graveyard I wish we were sittin and fishin and this wouldn't be so hard It was my favorite thing that we used to do but now we can't I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here And I wish this were a riverbank
