   There ain't no Rhyme or reason With you You never know What your gonna get But that makes you more Intriguing Each and every moment that we spend It don't matter when That's just like you To confuse me but You should know that You'll never lose me baby Hold on tight Just hang onto me Enjoy the ride That our life will bring Look in my eyes You'll see forever I know somehow We'll make it together Girl I don't care What you put me through I'll still love you You never show affection But when you do It's all at once And Then its gone I'm stunned Left breathless In a daze So amazed But I stay strong I'm still learning Your still trying I'm still fighting Your still denying baby Hold on tight Just hang onto me Enjoy the ride That our life will bring Look in my eyes You'll see forever I know somehow We'll make it together Girl I don't care What you put me through I'll still love you I'm still learning Your still trying I'm Still fighting Your Still denying Hold on tight Just hang onto me Enjoy the ride That our life will bring Look in my eyes You'll see forever I know somehow We'll make it together Girl I don't care What you put me through I'll still love you
