   I'm like a broken record A big ol' tow truck wrecker Couldn't pull me out of this groove The sun goes up and down This world keeps spinning 'round But I'm still stuck on You you you you You you you My friends all tease They needle me I sing the same ol' song The way you walk The way you talk I just go on and on I'm like a broken record A big ol' tow truck wrecker Couldn't pull me out of this groove The sun goes up and down This world keeps spinning 'round But I'm still stuck on You you you you You you you I let 'em know in stereo There's nothin' I can do I kiss and tell I can't help myself When I get started on you I'm like a broken record A big ol' tow truck wrecker Couldn't pull me out of this groove The sun goes up and down This world keeps spinning 'round But I'm still stuck on You you you you You you you Your lips your hair Your smile your touch I'm talkin' like a man Who has fallen in love I'm like a broken record A big ol' tow truck wrecker Couldn't pull me out of this groove The sun goes up and down This world keeps spinning 'round But I'm still stuck on You you you you You you you I'm like a broken record I'm like a broken record Just like a broken record Just just just like a broken record Like a broken record I'm like a broken record
