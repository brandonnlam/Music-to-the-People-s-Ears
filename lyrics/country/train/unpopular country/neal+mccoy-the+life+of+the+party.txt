   Every night I'm the life of the party I turn on with the neon lights And friends say I'm the object of envy The call me Mr. Right Oh I'm the life of the party I dance every dance with somebody new The don't see the life of the party Is dying without you I wear a smile everywhere I go Like a suit of armor or a heavy coat Everybody wants to be around me 'Cause I'm always good for a joke Oh I'm the life of the party I dance every dance with somebody new The don't see the life of the party Is dying without you No matter how hard I try Every laugh is another lie Oh I'm the life of the party I dance every dance with somebody new The don't see the life of the party Is dying without you
