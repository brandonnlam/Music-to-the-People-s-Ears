   Jon Mcelroy/Ned Mcelroy I'm cuttin off the telephone You unplug the tv At the rate life's passin us by We can't take the time to breathe I know you can't turn time around But maybe there's a way to slow it down Sippin' iced tea from a backporch swing Layin' by a river as the wold runs by Makin' sweet love while the Mockingbird sings We can try puttin' the brakes on time When did we last have a heart to heart talk Over a glass of wine Or stop and watch the grass grow Or smell a honeysuckle vine We can't put the sand back in the hourglass But we can hold each other baby And make the weekend last Sippin' iced tea from a backporch swing Layin' by a river as the wold runs by Makin' sweet love while the Mockingbird sings You and I puttin' the brakes on time Puttin' the brakes on time We've been sippin' iced tea from the backporch swing Lay down by the river as the world runs by Make sweet love while the Mockingbird songs Can't stop the clock but we can't sure enough try To put the brakes put the brakes on time
