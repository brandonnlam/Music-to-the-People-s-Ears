   Girl I hate me for how I hurt you 'Cause that ain't no way to love a woman I used up your heart and all your forgiveness I tore you apart and now you're down To where my apologies are just empty words And my tears are just salt and water Where down on my knees that's just bones on boards Yeah I'm very sorry don't matter anymore There was a time when I was the one That you trusted unconditionally Now look at you lookin' at me With that blank stare that only believes To where my apologies are just empty words And my tears are just salt and water Where down on my knees that's just bones on boards Yeah I'm very sorry don't matter anymore Girl I wish I could tell you How sorry I really am But I just can't 'cause I chose to make My apologies just empty words And my tears just salt and water Where down on my knees that's just bones on boards I'm where sorry don't matter I'm very sorry just don't matter I'm very sorry don't matter anymore
