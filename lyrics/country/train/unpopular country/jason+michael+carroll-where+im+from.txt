   On a three hour flight from Memphis to la I was silently celebrating my first class upgrade Laughing at my jeans and my boots Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free So if you'd like the first one can be on me He said I'm headin back from business in New York and Rome Tell me son Where do you call home I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church The courthouse clock it still don't work Where a man's word means everything Where moms and dads were high school flings Gave their children grandmothers maiden name Yes it may not sound like much But it's where I'm from So we drank that round and then another There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover He said I headed out west when I was barely 19 Just a kid chasing my dreams I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother He's been fighting the cancer they discovered But he called last night and said I think this is the end So come take me home to my family and my friends Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen The truck's a ford and the tractor's green And Amazing Grace is what we sing Well there's a county fair every fall And your friends are there every time you call Yeah It may not sound like much but it's Where I'm from And as we stood to claim the bags we checked He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that Italian suits haven't always been my style See I was quarterback of my high school team We took state back in '63 And my wife she's still my homecoming queen Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church A courthouse clock that still don't work Where a man's word means everything Where moms and dads wear high school flings Gave their children grandmothers maiden name Yes it may not sound like much I said it may not sound like much but it's where I'm from It's where I'm from Where I'm from Amazing Grace how sweet the sound...
