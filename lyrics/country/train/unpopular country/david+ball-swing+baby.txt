   Wood Newton/David Ball Once you were together now you're far apart The one who swore to love you has gone and broke your heart Don't cry on your pillow don't let it get you down Put on the party dress go out and paint the town Baby swing baby swing It's easy as the lullaby your momma used to sing Once you feel that rhythm you won't worry about a thing Just swing swing baby swing There's a juke joint down the highway past the city limit sign Check your troubles at the door go on and have a good time The band can play the boogie beat so wear your dancing shoes Let that old piano man pound away your blues Baby swing baby swing It's easy as the lullaby your momma used to sing Once you feel that rhythm you won't worry about a thing Just swing swing baby swing There's a juke joint down the highway past the city limit sign Check your troubles at the door go on and have a good time The band can play the boogie beat so wear your dancing shoes Let that old piano man pound away your blues Baby swing baby swing It's easy as the lullaby your momma used to sing Once you feel that rhythm you won't worry about a thing Just swing swing baby swing There's a juke joint down the highway past the city limit sign Check your troubles at the door go on and have a good time The band can play the boogie beat so wear your dancing shoes Let that old piano man pound away your blues
