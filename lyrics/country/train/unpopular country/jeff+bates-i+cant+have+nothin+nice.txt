Damn I can't have nothin nice Worked hard all my life Every time I get a piece of the pie If somebody don't snatch it or take em a bite It slides right off the plate into the beans and rice I can't have nothin' nice No I can't have nothin' nice I saved up and bought me a place A fixerup out on the lake Gave it tender love and care and elbow grease I met a girl down at the marina  We talked bait and drank margaritas She gave me a lip lock out on the boat dock and she hooked me Before too long we were hummin' along to wedding bells Then she kicked me out and put my house up for sale Well hell. I can't have nothin' nice Worked hard all my life Every time I get a piece of the pie If somebody don't snatch it or take em a bite It slides right off the plate into the beans and rice I can't have nothin' nice No I can't have nothin' nice I got a brand new Chevy in the junkyard A memory of a house and a broken heart And I sure hope my dreams don't come true twice I can't have nothin' nice Worked hard all my life Every time I get a piece of the pie If somebody don't snatch it or take em a bite It slides right off the plate into the beans and rice I can't have nothin' nice No I can't have nothin' nice I can't have nothin' nice Worked hard all my life I can't have nothin' nice No I can't have nothin' nice
