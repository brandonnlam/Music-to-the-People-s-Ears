Tennessee whiskey Baby are you with me Texas chili Virginia pine. It's hard to beat that California sunshine. Baby you're my favorite Favorite state of mind. It feels just like I've died and gone to Heaven. Your lips your eyes hell everything gets me revvin'. You're fearless and you're fun thirty flavors all in one. Crazy happy laughin' at me all that and then some. Hawaii's got big breaks Michigan Great Lakes Colorado snowflakes Georgia peaches. Louisiana hot food New York attitude Florida beaches.
