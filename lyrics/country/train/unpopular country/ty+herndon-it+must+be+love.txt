   I just dropped her off I'm thinkin' oh what a night I oughta be flying But I'm sittin' here at this green light I thought I was in control Thought I knew where I wanted to go She's got me turned inside out I'm wondering what it's all about Chorus: Is she there in your dreams I don't know I can't sleep Is she breaking your heart Yeah but isn't it sweet Does she know how you feel It's right on the tip of my tongue Are you walking on air Well I'm sure feelin' tall Does she trouble your mind It's no trouble at all Well I don' t know but something tells me It must be love I just missed my turn Guess I'm not thinking straight Oh and what's with this car It's driving me back to her place I'm out here circling around I've already covered this ground These feelings just can't be denied So what I am a trying to decide Chorus x2 I don't know but something tells me Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love
