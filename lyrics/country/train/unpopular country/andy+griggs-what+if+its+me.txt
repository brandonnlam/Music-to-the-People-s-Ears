   I threw that frame against the wall Washed my hands of all the pieces I poured another glass and I asked myself again What did I do to deserve this I started pacing back and forth Conjured up a hundred reasons But here I am again running from the truth 'Cause I can't start believing What if its me 'causing this heartache Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks Me fooling myself calling it the hand I'm dealt I'm sure that it's her but what if it's me What if it's me my own worst enemy Not giving her enough attention Ignoring all the little things Now I lie here all alone Getting lost in her prediction What if its me 'causing this heartache Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks Me fooling myself calling it the hand I'm dealt I'm sure that it's her but what if it's me And my selfish ways Me the one who needs to change Me who needs to take the blame For doing this to us What if its me 'causing this heartache Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks What if its me 'causing this heartache Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks Me fooling myself calling it the hand I'm dealt It's me What if it's me Yeah what if it's me Oh what if it's me What if it's me
