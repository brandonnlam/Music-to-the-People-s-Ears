   I believe in a helpin' hand But I think a man ought to stand up for himself. If prayer's what Sunday morning's for I love the Lord But I do raise a little hell... I will And I'm prepared to sacrifice for what is right But I'm not quite convinced... not yet That the men we sent to represent in the government Even know what the right thing is Listen to this Can I get an amen A shout-out from my rowdy redneck friends I'll say it again Am I gettin' through am I makin' sense Are we all on the same side of the fence Now's the time to get your two cents in Can I get an amen I believe in equal pay If the job's the same why pay somebody less It don't make sense. And I believe in women's rights But I ain't gonna lie I do like a short tight dress oh yes Can I get an amen A shout-out from my rowdy redneck friends I'll say it again Am I gettin' through am I makin' sense Are we all on the same side of the fence Don't you wanna get your two cents in Can I get an amen I believe in loud guitars smoky bars and muscle cars Pick-up trucks and gun control as long as they leave mine alone. Mother Freedom Father Time lookin' people in the eye And who you are means more than where you've been Can I get an amen A shout-out from my rowdy redneck friends I'll say it again Am I gettin' through am I makin' sense Are we all on the same side of the fence Don't you wanna get your two cents in Can I get an amen Oh yeah can I get an amen
