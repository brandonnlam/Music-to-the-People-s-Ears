   We only have 1 barn this a one horse town Took them 5 miles so came to shoot her down Make my record wrong to the liquor store But a French came through it ain’t there no more Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ ‘cause I just can’t do no wrong Mama Lucy was a hottie wore jeans too tight Til the big 10 revolver made ‘er see the light Now she’s asking about my home drama intentions  Get stoning around is out of the question Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ ‘cause I just can’t do no wrong Before the sort out smokes had a stop and go And a wild tailed beard run a beer check out the road I’m lookin’ got busted can’t bend on my breaks Come on mama cut me a break Come Sunday morning I jumped out of bed With amazing grace all running through my head You turned on the game and my screen went bad Mama must be prayin’ So I called little Johnny he can go easy drip Don’t care just can it a TV that works But my truck rolled down right in front of a church Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ ‘cause I just can’t do no wrong Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ Mama must be prayin’ ‘cause I just can’t do no wrong
