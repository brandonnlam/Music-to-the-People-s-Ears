   My heart felt like a mountain crashing. A dying victim of your crushing words. My courage trampled by your good-bye. My last shred of happiness suppress by the closing of your heart's door. (Chorus I hurt so bad I can't describe it. I can't breathe and I can't hide it. Will it ever fade  Is it here to stay Why must I hurt and feel this way You plucked your love from my native soul And ripped it from my pssionate heart. I watched it wither and die cold upon the floor Right before my tear filled eyes. (Chorus I hurt so bad I can't describe it. I can't breathe and I can't hide it. Will it ever fade  Is it here to stay Why must I hurt and feel this way Now in agony our paths are parting although I simply can't endure. But somewhere in the recent past our paths  began as friends And friends grew into lovers and a love took hold That grew so strong I can't conceive it's deepness. (chorus I hurt so bad I can't describe it. I can't breathe and I can't hide it. Will it ever fade  Is it here to stay Why must I hurt and feel this way Torn apart far to soon in a way far to wrong Under a canopy of circumstances that crown it And bittersweet memories taht compound it. A milestone in my life one that I had rather miss. Oh I'd give anything for just one embrace and anything Anything anything for just one fleeting stolen kiss. (chorus I hurt so bad I can't describe it. I can't breathe and I can 't hide it. Will it ever fade  Is it here to stay Why must I hurt and feel this way
