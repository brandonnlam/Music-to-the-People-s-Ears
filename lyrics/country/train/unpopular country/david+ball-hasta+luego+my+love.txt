   I know it's getting late I hear the nission bells Parting is bittersweet but this is not farewell As I give you one last kiss just remember this We'll meet again senorita I won't forget lying here in your arms You make it so hard to leave ya Hasta Luego my love We knew the time would come we'd have to say goodbye I'll hold you in my dreams each and every night I know as I walk away my heart will say We'll meet again senorita... I will miss you mi amor yo te quiero We'll meet again senorita... La la la la la la Hasta Luego my love la la la la la la Hasta Luego my love La la la la la la Hasta Luego my love la la la la la la Hasta Luego my love
