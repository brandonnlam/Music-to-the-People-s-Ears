   A Love That Strong If love was a river rushing down to the sea I'd wanna jump right into the middle of it Let it carry me It's pulling me under taking my breath away Rolling with the flow wherever it goes Whatever it takes I wanna love that strong I wanna love that wild I wanna dig that deep I wanna reach that high One that'll last a whole life long I wanna love that strong A man and a woman sitting in a small cafe They met fifty years ago in those same two chairs On this very day He still brings her flowers Just to hear that little laugh She still thinks he's a knight in shining armor It's as simple as that I wanna love that strong I wanna love that wild I wanna dig that deep I wanna reach that high One that'll last a whole life long I wanna love that strong I wanna go that far I wanna touch that fire I wanna see forever in your eyes I wanna love that strong I wanna love that wild I wanna dig that deep I wanna reach that high One that'll last a whole life long I wanna love that strong I wanna love that wild I wanna dig that deep I wanna reach that high One that'll last a whole life long I wanna love that strong
