   I can't help myself Baby I've tried and I've tried But I just don't want nobody else You did this to me You lit a fire that's still burning Down deep in my soul And now you expect me To just let you go Don't hate me for lovin' you It's all that I know to do You're my everything Oh oh don't ask me to give you up I live for your tender touch Oh don't be so mean Don't hate me for lovin' you Don't hate me for lovin' you Don't hate me for love lovin' you Dreams you're still in my dreams Sometimes so real That I still feel you Lying right here next to me I'm so sorry I called I know it's late And the last thing you Want me to say is I miss you A little bit more everyday Don't hate me for lovin' you It's all that I know to do You're my everything Oh oh don't ask me to give you up I live for your tender touch Oh don't be so mean Don't hate me for lovin' you Don't hate me for lovin' you Don't hate me for love lovin' you Don't hate me for love lovin' you
