   I'm slippin' into Slidell the boys and me Take a left at the Texaco gonna see Sweet Marie She plays down at Jimbeaux's Gumbo and Washtub In calico and barefeet in a band called the Mudbugs I been workin' up my never and I can hardly Tonight when she asks for request I'll stand up and say I wanna be your squeeze box Always at your fingertips I wanna be your blues harp A little closer to your lips Let me be your washboard You can play me fast or slow Squeeze box blues harp washboard baby Anything you can hold Got a bucket full of crawfish a seat on the front row Just to sit this close to her it's like a shot of tabasco Makin' trips to the tip jar keep it full of dollar bills Tonight I'm gonna go for broke show her just how I feel One way or another Lord she's gonna notice me If I have to jump up on that stage and get down on my knees I'll be beggin her please Let me be your squeeze box Always at your fingertips I wanna be your blues harp A little closer to your lips Let me be your washboard You can play me fast or slow Squeeze box blues harp washboard baby Anything you can hold Squeeze box blues harp washboard baby Anything you can hold
