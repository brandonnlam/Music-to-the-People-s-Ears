   Hey mister DJ I'm calling you Now can you play me some real cool tunes Something that sounds like a long time ago The kind of music that thrills my soul You must have something in your record rack A simple little song that can bring me back to when they Sang up on the roof And underneath the boardwalk when they'd go Dancin' in the streets Boogaloon' down on Broadway hey when Lovers used to slow dance all night long And they knew the words to every song There's got to be somebody somewhere Singin' some new old songs Like Otis Redding Sittin' On The Dock Or Bill Haley's Rock Around The Clock When Buddy Holly loved sweet Peggy Sue True love ways were all they knew There's somethin' 'bout happiness heartbreak and hurt That leaves me hangin on every word back when they Sang up on the roof And underneath the boardwalk when they'd go Dancin' in the streets Boogaloon' down on Broadway hey when Lovers used to slow dance all night long And they knew the words to every song Now that radio's on and I'm stayin' up Please dedicate it to the one I love like it was when they Sang up on the roof And underneath the boardwalk when they'd go Dancin' in the streets Boogaloon' down on Broadway hey when Lovers used to slow dance all night long And they knew the words to every song There's got to be somebody somewhere Singin' some new old songs Just like in the fifties High on a mountain of love In the midnight hour Oh knock on wood Kiss an angle good morning Your cheatin' heart
