   First date first kiss Well I never will forget The way you looked that night Parked out 'cross town Watchin' the stars fall down Girl your hair was soft and brown and Just before we get too far I'd hear you say It's gettin' late we need to go And it's a long way back Made plans got rings And had us a million dreams Where our road might lead It wasn't long we had a truck With all of our things boxed up Left town in a cloud of dust and Got movin' improvin' Why I can't say But suddenly it seems to be Such a long way back I've tried you've tried And nobody's satisfied Is this where it all ends We can't be so far down Where we can't turn around Pick up this love we found Just before we get too far I hear you say It's gettin' late we need to go And it's a long way Just before we get too far I here you say It's gettin' late we need to go And it's a long way back.
