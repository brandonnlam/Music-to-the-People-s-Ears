   Don't think 'I'm sorry''s what we need to say Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today Guilty... We're both guilty Let's walk through that door A second chance is what I'm talkin' about Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out Lay it on me baby till I can't take anymore... *Chorus No mercy show me no mercy Love me all night long and don't hurry Take it slow and easy no mercy tonight Hold me baby you know I've been hurtin' Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it Love me strong baby show me no mercy tonight Remember when we thought that bein' apart Would be the best thing for both our hearts It's a prison out there when you're livin' alone for sure Now I know how much I really missed you No more games just wanna be with you Just give me all your lovin' till you can't give any more... *Chorus No mercy show me no mercy Love me all night long and don't hurry Take it slow and easy no mercy tonight Hold me baby you know I've been hurtin Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it Love me strong baby show me no mercy tonight ~Bridge~ In the silence of the early hours I look at you and I feel the power Don't need promises to make it right Let's just follow what we're feelin' inside... *Chorus Hold me baby you know I've been hurtin' Love this love back to life 'cause it's worth it Love me strong baby show me no mercy tonight No mercy show me no mercy tonight Love me strong and show me no mercy tonight
