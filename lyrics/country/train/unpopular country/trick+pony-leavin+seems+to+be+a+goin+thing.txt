   Three months ago Tom and Becky Jones had a fight She left hi overnight Then my next-door neighbor said his woman gave him fits He up and called it quits The couple down the block barely finished their house I learned this mornin' he's already moved out I don't like what's goin' down Spreadin' like fire all over this town Up and gone has done caught on How else do you explain Leavin' seems to be the goin' thing It's the goin' thing Now here I am on this front porch tryin' to understand This letter in my hand You left it sittin' on the table when you went for a walk It said we need to talk You can understand my concern I'm thinkin' maybe it's my turn I don't like what's goin' down Spreadin' like fire all over this town Up and gone has done caught on How else do you explain Leavin' seems to be the goin' thing It's the goin' thing I'm not the kind to overreact But you can't deny the cold hard facts I don't like what's goin' down Spreadin' like fire all over this town Up and gone has done caught on How else do you explain Leavin' seems to be the goin' thing It's the goin' thing
