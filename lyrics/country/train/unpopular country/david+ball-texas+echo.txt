   Under the open skies deep in the heart of Texas The sun shines down on the cotton field As the clouds roll by across the sky Carry my love to the Rio Grande Please send my echo floating down through the canyon Maybe she will hear my call I'll be there soon I'll bring the moon On a string of stars just for you I miss the one I call my own why did I leave her alone Two days more on this lonesome ride Then she'll be riding by my side Under the open sky deep in the heart of Texas I can almost hear her calling me I miss the one I call my own why did I leave her alone Two days more on this lonely ride then she'll be riding by my side Under the open sky deep in the heart of Texas The sun shines down on the cotton field As the clouds roll on by across the sky Carry my love to the Rio Grande
