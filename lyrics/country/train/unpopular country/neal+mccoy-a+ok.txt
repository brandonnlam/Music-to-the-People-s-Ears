   Oh it’s alright Everybody is gotta get some lose some time If you are up tight...  It’s alright x2 It’s ok Save the trouble for another day Put a big old smile back on your face Looks to me like it’s gonna be A-ok x3 Let me raise a toast For all of those who are feeling just like me Keep your head out the covers There is a hell lot of others Who are tired to lose and sleep ... worries that hold you down Cause it’s good for the soul … Oh it’s alright Everybody is gotta get some lose some time If you are up tight...  It’s alright x2 It’s ok Save the trouble for another day Put a big old smile back on your face Looks to me like it’s gonna be A-ok x3 So go on take up Like a rocket through the sky If it feels good That’s good You don’t need another reason why You can lay there like a book on the shelve Wise man say Chorus Oh it’s alright Everybody is gotta get some lose some time If you are up tight...  It’s alright x2 It’s ok Save the trouble for another day Put a big old smile back on your face Looks to me like it’s gonna be A-ok x3
