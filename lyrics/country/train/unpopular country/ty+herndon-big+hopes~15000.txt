   I'm not brave and I'm not too smart The tin man wouldn't trade for my heart Got two left feet when I am dancing A long history of brief romances Got no rubies got no diamonds None passed down and I can not but them Got a box of hurt and a bag of shame And you barely know my name Chorus I've got big big hopes about you I've got big big hopes Got an old leather jacket would look good on you And lots of friends they would like you too I've got some pull with the moon and tides And thirty two dollars let's go somewhere tonight Chorus I've got big big hopes about you I've got big big hopes Bridge I've had hopes before but not like this I'm flying over the edge into loves sweet abyss I've got some pull with the moon and tides And thirty two dollars let's go somewhere tonight
