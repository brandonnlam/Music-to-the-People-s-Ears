   Walt Aldridge/Brad Crisler I went to pieces when she blew in Like a strong man running through a hurricane wind Before I had a clue how bad it would be She tore my heart out and she showed it to me Like a bone in a pit bull pen She chewed me up and spit me out again My knees still shake my ears still ring All in all it was a pretty good thing All in all it was a pretty good thing That was one ride that I'll never forget I still ain't found all the pieces yet She stripped my gears-she stole my shocks And she left me sitting up here on these cinder blocks Like a bone in a pit bull pen She chewed me up and spit me out again My knees still shake my ears still ring All in all it was a pretty good thing All in all it was a pretty good thing I know it's bound to sound a little crazy to you But it sure was good for a minute or two Like a bone in a pit bull pen She chewed me up and spit me out again My knees still shake my ears still ring All in all it was a pretty good thing All in all it was a pretty good thing
