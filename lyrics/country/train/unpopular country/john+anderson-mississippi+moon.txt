   Mississippi Moon It's a late night show on the radio Going down the road with the Wolfman Lightning bugs all around moonlight shining down On little sleepy towns down in the flatlands I can still hear momma calling son it's time to come on in When the darkness started falling... Everybody gathered round the table amen Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze wish I'd never left you Spent enough time in that old rat race Goin on back in the delta Barbecues back porch stews and the guitar blues just about sundown Mockingbird melodies watermelon memories... Cruisin the streets downtown Hot summer night down on the levy She spread the blanket on the ground There ain't no feeling like the first time When the innocence is lost and love is found Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze almost reach and touch you Been a long time and I missed your face Goin on back to the deltaI'm tired of searching for the answers Always out there on the run I'm goin back to where my heart is... Down on Highway 61 Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze almost reach and touch you Been a long time and I missed your face Goin on back to the delta Mississippi Moon hangin in the haze wish I'd never left you Had enough time in that old rat raceGoin on back to the delta
