   Feat. Shelagh Brown I can hear the sound It's really coming down Bring on the pain Water on your skin Where do I begin We got caught in the rain Still think about that night It was the first the last time I ever held you tight I can hear her voice call my name So caught up there in the moment So much passion and emotion Then it fades as the clouds roll away Yes I still think about you every now and then But only when it rains Looking out I see Where we use to be Soaked through our clothes Nothings ever changed And it never will Even though I know what I know now I can hear your voice call my name So caught up there in the moment So much passion and emotion Then it fades as the clouds roll away Yes I still think about you every now and then But only when it rains I can't forget you No not at all As thunder sounds and lightening strikes When the first drops start to fall I can hear your voice call my name So caught up there in the moment So much passion and emotion Then it fades as the clouds roll away Yes I still think about you every now and then I still think about you every now and then But only when it rains
