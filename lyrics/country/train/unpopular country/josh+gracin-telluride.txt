   When I was nineteen I threw my stuff in the car I headed up to the Rockies got a job at this bar Sellin beer to the locals just barely getting by On the tips from the rich kids there on daddys dime But when I saw her walk in one night I knew that Id be all right in Telluride the snow fallin down I was wakin up in that sleepy little town In her eyes my world came so alive I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire castin shadows on the cabin wall drownin in desire Confessin all our secrets and laughin out loud so high up on that mountain I thought wed never come down It was a dream we were livin in and I was the happiest Id ever been in Telluride the snow fallin down wakin up with her in that sleepy little town In her eyes my world came so alive I never will forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride Telluride whoa-oh-oh It ended just like a movie scene and I had to play the part Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave and me with the frozen heart In Telluride the snow fallin down standin there alone in that sleepy little town In her eyes my world came so alive I never will forget the day she said goodbye In Telluride the snow fallin down wakin up with her in that sleepy little town In her eyes my world came so alive I never will forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride
