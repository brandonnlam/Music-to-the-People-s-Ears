   Jimmy was waitin' on Shelby Jean In the parking lot at the Dairy Queen He knew she's gonna be there soon Then they'll blow this town Just like a cheap balloon She came in cryin' this morning at the store Said I swear Jimmy I just can't take no more So he quit his job and drew his pay Now he's helpin' Shelby make her getaway Oh... Sittin' on  go Waitin' on sundown Waitin' on sundown No more beatin' to be denied No more bruises that makeup can't hide All these years she tried to love that man But all he ever gave her Was the back of his hand Now Jimmy is a young boy Just out of his teens So many things that he still hasn't seen But he's old enough to know wrong from right That's why he's helpin' Shelby Make a break tonight And oh... Sittin' on go Waitin' on sundown Waitin' on sundown Waitin' on sundown Drove all night drove all day Jimmy listened to everything Shelby had to say How she'd suffered at her lover's hand He said honey I wanna change all that if I can They pulled over to take a little rest Shelby put her head down on Jimmy's chest And she could hear the beatin' of his heart And it sounded like the rhythm of a brand new start And oh she's gonna let him know She's waitin' on sundown She's just waitin' on sundown They're waitin' on sundown Waitin' on sundown
