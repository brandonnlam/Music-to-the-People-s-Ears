   Written by: Doug Supernaw Performed by Doug Supernaw on Red and Rio Grande Like a kid on a carousel I go around in circles Not knowing whether to be scared Of all the ups and downs By the face you could never tell That inside I'm hurtin' I'm always on the move But never gainin' ground And the brightly painted ponies They have feelings inside Like me do they ever want To get off of this ride And the mirrors in the middle reflect Years of going nowhere Of trying to catch the horse out in front When you know there's not a prayer Somehow through the pain I'll grab hold of the reins And all will end up well When I stop this carousel
