   I thought I had it beat I thought I was cured I didn't feel the need for you anymore I had an iron will so I dropped my guard Then I found I still had you in my heart I gave up I tried my best It's time to admit I'm powerless but... Hey I'm gonna be fine Takin' it one step at a time Prayin' you right off of my mind If only for today I may never be free It's a lifelong recovery But when I think of you and me At least I cut it down to every other memory Once a habit's formed man it's hard to quit I'm countin' on the Lord to help me forget His tender kiss and the way we touched I tried to resist but I'm not strong enough Little by little I'm facing the facts It's two steps forward and one step back Hey I'm gonna be fine Takin' it one step at a time Prayin' you right off of my mind If only for today I may never be free It's a lifelong recovery But when I think of you and me At least I cut it down to every other memory Hey I'm gonna be fine Takin' it one step at a time Prayin' you right off of my mind If only for today I may never be free It's a lifelong recovery But when I think of you and me At least I cut it down to every other memory At least I cut it down to every other memory Every other memory
