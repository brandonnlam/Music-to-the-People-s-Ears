   Yeah me Jim and Dan we were all best friends. Riding off like cowboys on a road that never ends. We knew it was our last time for the time of our lives.... See Dan was getting married Jim was going to desert storm I was heading off to college moving into a dorm. So we took off in that old hot rod back when we were Gods.
