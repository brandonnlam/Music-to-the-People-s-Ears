   I've taken down all of your pictures Put neon up on the wall Hung pool-table lights from the fixtures And I built me a bar down the hall I hired me a man he comes in at six He stays 'til I turn out the lights He's there with a drink when I need a fix To help you get off of my mind I'm not thinkin' straight anymore Not since you walked out that door I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool Watchin' that bartender pour I'm not thinkin' straight anymore Now everyone's got their opinion Most people think I'm just gone They question my new way of thinkin' They ask me what planet I'm on When I cross that long bridge that goes into town That water reminds me of wine The buildings they all look like bottles And it takes me right back in time I'm not thinkin' straight anymore Not since you walked out that door I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool Watchin' that bartender pour I'm not thinkin' straight anymore There's no use pretending I need something mind-bending To help me get over you I'm not thinkin' straight anymore Not since you walked out that door I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool Watchin' that bartender pour I'm not thinkin' straight anymore I'm not thinkin' straight anymore Not since you walked out that door I just sit on this stool like a heartbroken fool Watchin' that bartender pour I'm not thinkin' straight anymore I'm not thinkin' straight anymore I'm not thinkin' straight anymore
