   Tim Johnson/Kelly Cole Black smoke rolling from my old Rambler I pulled into Joe's Auto Supply Desperate for some kind of answer Ol' Joe he's a friend of mine I said Hey Joe I've got a problem And I told him about what you had done He looked at me and he shook his head And said sorry I can't help you son I can fix your carburetor I can rebuild your alternator I can change the plugs I can change the wires Replace all four bald tires I've got a warehouse full of parts But I don't know a thing about a broken heart No I don't know a thing about a broken heart So I went down to ol' Doc Miller's I told the nurse he just had to see me He took me in when he heard me tell her This was an emergency I said Oh Doc she really hurt me And then my tears fell like rain He said I've had at least a million patients But never one in so much pain I could write you a prescription Give you a straight shot of penicillin I could run a hundred different tests Or put a stethoscope to your chest And if it stops I'll give you cpr But I don't know a thing about a broken heart No I don't know a thing about a broken heart So girl that's how I finally wound up at your door Hopin' that you had the answers I've been searchin' for 'Cause I don't even have a clue of how I'll ever get over you So tell me now where do I start 'Cause I don't know a thing about a broken heart No I don't know a thing about a broken heart Lord I don't know a thing about a broken heart
