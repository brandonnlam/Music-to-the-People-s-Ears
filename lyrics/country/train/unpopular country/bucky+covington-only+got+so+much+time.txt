   Life's too short to drink cheaper wine And God don't like you The way sun shine in Napa Roth We've only got so much time You take a vacation Every once in a while We buy some new clothes that ain't out of style and put ‘em on We've only got so moch time If you gonna dance you gotta tear it on the dance floor You sing sing out the top of your lungs And act like it's more you never heard before That's right we've only got so much time Hop you in the truck if somebody's moving Call up your brother just say how you're doin' How ‘bout them Steelers boy We've only got so much time When a baby gets born hand out cigars Get back with the kids in your own backyard Play flashlight tag We've only got so much time If you gonna dance you gotta tear it on the dance floor You sing sing out the top of your lungs And act like it's more you never heard before That's right we've only got so much time When I sit at the table don't forget to say grace And don't be afraid you took Ty in the base ‘Cause after all We've only got so much time And they were friendly too And give it don't wrong it Can sit by the ocean and pretend that you own it Yea you know We've only got so much time If you gonna dance you gotta tear it on the dance floor You sing sing out the top of your lungs And act like it's more you never heard before That's right we've only got so much time We've only we've only We've only got so much time
