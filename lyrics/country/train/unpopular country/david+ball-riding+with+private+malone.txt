   I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds When an ad that said: Old Chevy somehow caught my eye The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran But I had that thousand dollars in my hand It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn Thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp When I pulled the cover off it took away my breath What she'd called a Chevy was a sixty six Corvette I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills But what a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note The date was nineteen-sixty and this is what he wrote: He said My name is Private Andrew Malone "If you're reading this then I didn't make it home "But for every dream that's shattered another one comes true "This car was once a dream of mine now it belongs to you "And though you may take her and make her your own "You'll always be riding with Private Malone Well it didn't take me long at all I had her running good I love to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood I had her shining lika a diamond and I'd put the rag top down All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her though town The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right But it picked up that oldie show especially late at night I'd get the feeling sometimes if I turned real quick I'd see A soldier riding shotgun in the seat right next to me It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone Who fought for his country and never made it home But for every dream that's shattered another one comes true This car was once a dream of his back when it was new He told me to take her and make her my own And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone One night it was raining hard I took the curve too fast I still don't remember much about that fiery crash Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out They didn't get his name but I without a doubt It was a young man named Private Malone Who fought for his country and never made it home But for every dream that's shattered another one comes true This car was once a dream of his back when it was new I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along That night I was riding with Private Malone Oh thank God I was riding with Private Malone
