   So you sailed away Into a grey sky morning Now I'm here to stay Love can be so boring Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now Chorus 2: But it's not so bad You're only the best I've ever had You don't want me back You're just the best I've ever had So you stole my world Now I'm just a phony Remembering the girl Leaves me down and lonely Send it in a letter Make yourself feel better Repeat chorus 2 And it may take some time to Patch me up inside But I can't take it so I Run away and hide And I may find in time that You were always right You're always right Repeat chorus 1 What was it you wanted Could it be I'm haunted But it's not so bad You're only the best I ever had I don't want you back You're just the best I ever had The best I ever had
