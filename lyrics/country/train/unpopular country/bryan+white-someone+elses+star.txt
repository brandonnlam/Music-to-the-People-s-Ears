   Alone again tonight Without someone to love The stars are shining So one more wish goes up Oh I wish I may And I wish with all my might For the love I'm dreaming of And missing in my life You'd think that I could find A true love of my own It happens all the time To people that I know Their wishes all come true So I've got to believe There's still someone out there who Is meant for only me I guess I must be wishing on Someone else's star It seems like someone else keeps getting What I'm wishing for Why can't I be as lucky As those other people are I guess I must be wishing On someone else's star I sit here in the dark And stare up at the sky But I can't give my heart One good reason why Everywhere I look It's lovers that I see It seems like everyone's in love With everyone but me I guess I must be wishing on Someone else's star It seems like someone else keeps getting What I'm wishing for Why can't I be as lucky As those other people are I guess I must be wishing On someone else's star Why can't I be as lucky As those other people are Oh I guess I must be wishing On someone else's star
