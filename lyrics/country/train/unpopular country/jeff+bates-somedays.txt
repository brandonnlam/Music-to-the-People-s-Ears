   Work sucks when your busting your butt Just to come up short at the end of the month And it’s bad when your checkbook’s sad And you can’t party hard 'cause there ain’t no credit on your credit card Ain’t no sense in ya getting all mad 'cause some days are just like that But some days are like this You swing for the fence and you just can’t miss When life goes like you know it should It’s all good in the hillbilly hood Everything’s cool everything’s right You couldn’t screw it up even if you tried Some days are hell but the good news is Some days are like this Life’s crap when you’re sleeping on the couch 'Cause of something that you said and you gotta go without Yeah it stinks when you ain’t in sync with the one that you love And you can’t find your way to the way it was Don’t write it off as a deal gone bad 'cause some days are just like that But some days are like this You wake up in the morning to a smile and a big kiss When love goes like you know it should It’s all good in the hillbilly hood Everything’s cool everything’s right You couldn’t screw it up even if you tried Some days are hell but the good news is Some days are like this But some days are like this You swing for the fence and you just can’t miss When life goes like you know it should It’s all good in the hillbilly hood Everything’s cool everything’s right You couldn’t screw it up even if you tried Some days are hell but the good news is Some days are like this some days are like this
