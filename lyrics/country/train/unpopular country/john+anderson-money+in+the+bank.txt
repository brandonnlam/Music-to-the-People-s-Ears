   It's Friday night baby get ready set go.. Gonna take you to the Krystal and a picture show. Well the sky's the limit there's no price too high,. Baby you're the apple of my eye. Got my paycheck in my pocket and some gas in the tank: Honey your love's better than money in the bank. I wish I had a bass boat and a Z-28. But I guess that stuff'll have to wait. 'Cause I'm saving on a washer and a wedding ring I want this love to be a lasting thing. Right at the top that's where you rank: Honey your love's better than money in the bank. Oh oh you make me feel like a million bucks. Oh oh I oughta drive you around in an armored truck. Late last night I had a crazy dream. I met a man who invented a money machine. He said: I know things are tight and times are tough But he'd give me the machine if I'd give you up. I just looked him in the eye and I said: No thanks. Honey your love's better than money in the bank. Honey your love's better than money in the bank.
