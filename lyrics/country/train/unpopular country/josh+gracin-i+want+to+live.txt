   Sometimes I feel like I need To shake myself To wake myself I feel like I'm just sleepwalkin' Through my life Its like I'm swimming in An ocean of emotion But still somehow slowly Goin numb inside I don't like who I'm becomin' I know I've gotta do somethin' Before my life passes right by Somethin deep inside Keeps sayin Life is like a vapor Its gone in just a twinklin' of an eye I want to take every Breath I can get I want to live Yeah yeah
