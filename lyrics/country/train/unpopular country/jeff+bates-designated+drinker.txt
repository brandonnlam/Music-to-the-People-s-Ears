   I left my keys on the dreser when she left me I knew I wouldn't need them tonight I called the boys to come pick me up And left my truck sitting there in the drive Well I'll be here 'til closing time Trying to drink her off my mind Chorus I've had a long neck a Long Island Tea A few fuzzy navels and sex on the beach Some straight up some on the rocks I'll probably eat the worm before I stop I ain't the driver I aint the thinker Tonight I'm the desgnated drinker Well there's always one in every honky-tonk Who has a lot of pain to ease So I wont be hard for the boys to find Whenever it's times to leave Well I'll be down at the end of the bar Standing on my own two knees Chorus I aint the driver I aint the thinker Tonight I'm the designated drinker I aint the driver I aint the thinker Tonight I'm the designated drinker
