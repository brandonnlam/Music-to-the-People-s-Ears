   David Ball/Allen Shamblin You disappear a day or so I have no idea where you go Then out of the blue you cross my mind It's me and you just like old times Walking in the autumn breeze An kicking up the falling leaves I close my eyes an you're right here Saying this is my favorite time of year Whenever you come back to me I run to meet your memory And let it take me back to yesterday Down a country road that winds Through golden leaves and better times To a place where my heart longs to be Whenever you come back to me Even though I know you're gone I read your name written on the stone In my dreams there's a river wide Where we walk side by side We leave footprints in the sand You let go of my hand At the waters edge you turn and smile And say I'll see you in a little while Whenever you come back to me I run to meet your memory And let it take me back to yesterday Down a country road that winds Through golden leaves and better times To a place where my heart longs to be Whenever you come back to me Oh whenever you come back to me
