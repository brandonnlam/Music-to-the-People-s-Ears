   I didn't mean to break your window I was trying to wake you up When I saw you out last night it hit me like a truck I tried to call all day at work didn't they give you my fax And I want my goodbye back Chorus: I had a momentary temporary lack of self control I said this and I said that I was really on a roll It's been downhill ever since my good sense jumped the track And I want my goodbye back My doctor says I'm better now but I sill feel the pain I showed him your picture he said man you were insane He asked me for your number now his left eye is black And I want my goodbye back Chorus Yeah I want my goodbye back
