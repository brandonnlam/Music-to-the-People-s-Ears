   Looking out across the field is the old highway Here comes a Ford there goes a Chevrolet Well I got my heart set on seeing her Cadillac Yeah I'm sittin' here watchin' my baby not coming back I put a million miles on this rocking chair of mine Going back and forth over everything in my mind I said this when I should have been sayin' that Now I'm sittin' here watchin' my baby not coming back I've got every single thing I should've said memorized For the minute that car of hers pulls up the drive But the longer she's gone the more I realize All that's headin' my way is a broken heart a tractor trailer and a foreign car I've got every single thing... I'm watching everything that comes around the curve Sittin' here wishin' that I'd gone after her But at that time I was much too proud for that Now I'm sittin' here watchin' my baby not coming back Yeah I'm sittin' here watchin' my baby not coming back Oh sittin' here watchin' my baby not coming back
