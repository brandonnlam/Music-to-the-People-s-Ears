   Songwriters: Hayslip Ben Yeary Jimmy Your face lights up every time You talk about that one red light Town you grew up in Your mind goes racin' down that road When another memory takes ahold And your smilin' like you're there again Your cruisin' through that parkin' lot With a couple friends hangin' out the top And you remember how it felt being young wild crazy Baby I wanna be that feelin' I wanna be that wind blowin' through your hair When life was like your favorite song And those summer days went on and on And it felt like you could do no wrong I wanna be that feelin' I wanna be a time ablaze And always takes your breath away Someday when you're lookin' back I wanna be a picture there In your mind that you take everywhere That warms your heart and makes you laugh Yeah baby these are the good ole days Let's make it last what do you say Remember being young wild crazy Baby I wanna be that feelin' I wanna be that wind blowin' through your hair Those Friday nights you were livin' for And that boyfriend knockin' at your door And everyday made you want him more I wanna be that feelin' Yeah Yeah when life was like your favorite song And those summer days went on and on And it felt like you could do no wrong That long lost feelin' Those Friday nights you were livin' for And that boyfriend knockin' at your door And everyday made you want him more I wanna be that feelin' I wanna be that feelin' Yeah Yeah I wanna be that feelin'
