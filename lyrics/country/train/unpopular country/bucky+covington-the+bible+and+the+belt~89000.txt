   Well I grew up back in the sticks I was raised on cornbread and scripture And praise God for teachin' me wrong from right I had a wild streak Three counties wide They would have me Dead in the sack It was the hand of God' That got me out of the hands of the law Mama taught the bible Daddy wore the belt Momma set the table Daddy rang the bell The preacher did his best to show me the light But daddy was the one that kept me walkin' the line Momma sang the gospel Daddy drove it home Momma was an angel Daddy was the brimstone One foot in heaven One foot in hell I found religion between the bible and the belt I guess it rings true But the good book says What you learn young You never forget Daddy's belt left quite an impression on me I can still hear Momma's voice in the choir She set the whole dang church on fire And it still burns in the deepest part of me Mama taught the bible Daddy wore the belt Momma set the table Daddy rang the bell The preacher did his best to show me the light But daddy was the one that kept me walkin' the line Momma sang the gospel Daddy drove it home Momma was an angel Daddy was the brimstone One foot in heaven One foot in hell I found religion between the bible and the belt Mama taught the bible Daddy wore the belt Momma set the table Daddy rang the bell The preacher did his best to show me the light But daddy was the one that kept me walkin' the line Momma sang the gospel Daddy drove it home Momma was an angel Daddy was the brimstone One foot in heaven One foot in hell I found religion between the bible and the belt
