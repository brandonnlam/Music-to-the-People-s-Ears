   Oh my I packed my bag I picked a fight I left for good just the other night I don't feel light like I thought it would I can't go home like I wished I could 'cause somethings up I can tell Shes takin my leaving a little too well She aint been sufferin by herself since I been gone My babys got a brand new something goin on I get dressed up I go down town I do my best just to track her down Our old friend Lord they don't say much Shes out of town And out of touch Chorus: 'cause somethings up I can tell Shes takin my leaving a little too well She aint been sufferin by herself since I been gone My babys got a brand new something goin on Aint no note Aint no news Aint no clothes and there aint no shoes Aint no car left in the drive Aint woman livin here tonight Chorus: 'cause somethings up I can tell Shes takin my leaving a little too well She aint been sufferin by herself since I been gone My babys got a brand new something goin on Chorus: Somethings up I can tell Shes takin my leaving a little too well She aint been sufferin by herself since I been gone My babys got a brand new something Yall My babys got a brand new something goin on Here she come Ha there she goes
