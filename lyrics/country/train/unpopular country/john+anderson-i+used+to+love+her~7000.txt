   How many years will this clock have to tick How many tears have to fall How many nights must I lie here and wonder If I'm gonna survive this at all Waking up and reaching out for no one Is the hardest part to get over I can't wait for the day when I can finally say I used to love her I'm gettin' better at walkin' the floor I'm wearin' holes in my shoes I keep on looking for something I've lost As if I had something to lose Calling out her name while nobody answers Is the hardest part to get over I can't wait for the day when I can finally say I used to love her This endless wall of heartache and pain I can't seem to get over I can't wait for the day when I can finally say I used to love her I can't wait for the day when I can finally say I used to love her.
