   Writer: Mickey Cates Nineteen hundred seventy-three My second cousin Calvin and me We loaded down his old blue-green Corvair And headed for the State Fair Was mid-October and the autumn breeze Shook the colors out of the trees Time was passing but who where we to care We were headed for the State Fair Chorus: And I remember Calvin Reaching underneath the dash Pulling out that pack of cigarettes That he kept stashed For half the morning We blew smoke rings in the air Like two big fat Millionaires It happened way out on Route Twenty-nine Some drunk driver came across the yellow line Calvin's momma cried and his daddy sat and stared Life can sure be unfair It's been so long since that dark day I thought by now I'd have put the past away But just this morning I found myself back there Going to the State Fair Repeat chorus
