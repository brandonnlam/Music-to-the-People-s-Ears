   Like a beat up boat that never made it to the shore Like an old love letter hidden in the bottom drawer Like a shiny penny heads up on the ground I've been found Like a message in a bottle in the sand Like the ace of hearts that shows up in your hand Like an old lost love the second time around Found I've been found hungry like the desert Waitin' on a drop of rain Found lost for so long No I never thought that I'd be saved Somehow I finally discovered That this is where I wanna stay Baby now I've been found When I'm here with you underneath the sheets It's a perfect world so whole and so complete You're the simple truth that makes me who I am A better man I've been found hungry like the desert Waitin' on a drop of rain Found lost for so long No I never thought that I'd be saved Somehow I finally discovered That this is where I wanna stay Baby now I've been found Well I've been found I've been found hungry like the desert Waitin' on a drop of rain Found lost for so long No I never thought that I'd be saved Somehow I finally discovered That this is where I wanna stay Baby now I've been found I've been found I've been found I've been found
