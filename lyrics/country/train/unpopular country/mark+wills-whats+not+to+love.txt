   That mirror's been lyin' to you 'Cause my eyes see the same girl I gave my heart to Where you see time's erosion I see beauty growin' But you wonder if I'm still in love with you What's not to love about perfection Honesty and passion You're the purest form of heaven on earth What kind of man could lose a feelin' for The nights we spent behind these doors Livin' every man's dream without wakin' up Yes I love you what's not to love You're hearin' these stories from friends At first how love works at last how it ends But the thing that makes us different Is this love's got you in it And I'd fall for you all over again What's not to love about perfection Honesty and passion You're the purest form of heaven on earth What kind of man could lose a feelin' for The nights we spent behind these doors Livin' every man's dream without wakin' up Yes I love you what's not to love What kind of man could lose a feelin' for The nights we spent behind these door's Livin' every man's dream without wakin' up Yes I love you what's not to love
