   I was born dirt poor on a dead end country road My every dream was to just grow up and go Like a siren song those bright lights called my name So I turned that country road into memory lane Well I hit that fast lane it was paved with gold But it wasn't long 'til my highbrow ways got old I started missing things that I thought I'd left behind 'Til I found two swinging doors 'neath the neon sign They were whirling and a twirling to the fiddles and a steel guitar Them city folk was drinking from Mason jars I think I found what paradise might be The city put the country back in me When you leave the farm you don't have to leave your room Just go on home and slip on them cowboy boots Now it's the best of both worlds all I'll ever need The city put the country back in me They were whirling and a twirling to the fiddles and a steel guitar Them city folk was drinking from Mason jars I think I found what paradise might be The city put the country back in me Yeah the city put the country back in me
