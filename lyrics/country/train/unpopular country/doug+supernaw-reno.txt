   Couldn't roll me a seven If you gave me loaded dice I couldn't draw a hand If I sat here all night Scared money bad whiskey There ain't no way to win This ain't the first time It's the way it's always been You know the Lady's a lot like Reno She ain't got a heart And she don't care when your down Just like the lights of a casino She'll pull you in And play with you awhile But there ain't no way to win I know she's a lot like Reno They're both out to break you Take everything you got When you finally win the hand There ain't nothing in the pot A gamble that I'm taking But either one I choose Lady or Reno either way I lose You know the lady's a lot like Reno She ain't got a heart And she don't care when you're down Just like the lights of a casino She'll pull you in And play with you awhile But there ain't no way to win And I know she's a lot like Reno You know the lady's a lot like Reno She ain't got a heart She don't care when you're down Just like the lights of a casino She'll pull you in And play with you awhile But there ain't no way to win I know she's a lot like Reno Couldn't roll me a seven If you gave me loaded dice
