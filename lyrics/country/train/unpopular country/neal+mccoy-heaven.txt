   I could climb up to the top of a moutain I could fly a plane as high as it could go But still I'd be no closer to Heaven I'll have to wait until it's time to go home I stood upon the edge of the Grand Canyon And yes it is a miracle to see But even though it's hard to imagine There is a place more beautiful to me And I thank God that there's a Heaven A place to go when my days are through I do not have to go far to get there not yet Cause Heaven is at home with you After all the years that we have been together I don't have to ask what love is worth Cause when I hold you close there is no question That Heaven really can be found on Earth And I thank God that there's a Heaven A place to go when my days are through I do not have to go far to get there not yet Cause Heaven is at home with you My Heaven is at home with you
