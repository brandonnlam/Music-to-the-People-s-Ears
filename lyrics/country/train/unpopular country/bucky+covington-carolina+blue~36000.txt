   There's something missing in the air tonight That old Rockingham moon knows just how to find. Here I am a thousand miles away There ain't nothing like you girl here in la. Chasing dreams and watching em' come true Everything is coming my way but you But you... Oh I'm Carolina blue and I'm surely missing you And those Smokey Mountain nights when you made everything right. Your voice gets me through the night But it's breaking my heart just to know you that you're missin' me Girl that's what's keepin' me Carolina blue. You always talked about heading out west Taking our chances leaving everything else. Standing here on this coast alone Thinkin' 'bout you leaves one way to go. Come tomorrow we wont need a telephone. Don't look for me here 'cause I'll be gone Well I'm comin' home. 'Cause I'm Carolina blue And I'm surely missing you and those smokey mountain nights When you made everything right. Your voice gets me through the night But it's breaking my heart just to know that you're missin' me Girl that's what's keepin' me Carolina blue. 'Till I'm back in your arms There's only one thing to do. 'Till the whole wide world is back Just me and you. Oh I'm Carolina blue And I'm surely missing you and those Smokey Mountain nights when you made Everything right. Your voice gets me through the night But it's breaking my heart just to know that you're missin' me Girl that's what's keepin' me Carolina blue. Hey Hey Yeah Carolina blue. Yeah...
