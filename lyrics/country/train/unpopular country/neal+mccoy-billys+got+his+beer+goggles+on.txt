   Billy's at the bar. He's been there all night. First ten beers he's had since her goodbye. Hey Hey She left him broke in his new truck. He don't smoke but he lights one up. Temporary fix for his heartache. He's hurting bad but he's feeling great. He's on the dance floor yellin free bird. Singin off pitch but he knows every word. Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight. He's chasin everything in sight. He'll fall apart when he gets home. But right now his worries are gone. Life looks good good good. Billy's got his beer goggles on. Hey Alot of drunks get real mean. They'll pick a fight over anything. Billy wants to laugh that's why he's here. Won't see him cry unless you spill his beer. He's on the dance floor yellin free bird. Singin off pitch but he knows every word. Grabs him a another girl and holds on tight. He's chasin everything in sight. He'll fall apart when he gets home. But right now his worries are gone. Life looks good good good. Billy's got his beer goggles.... On. He's on the dance floor yellin free bird. Singin off pitch but he knows every word. Grabs him a another girl and holds on tight. He don't see ugly through blood shot eyes. He'll fall apart when he gets home. Right now his worries are gone. Cause life looks good good good. So good good good. Life looks good good good. Billy's got his beer goggles..... On. How many fingers am I holdin' up Billy Get up Billy. Get Up
