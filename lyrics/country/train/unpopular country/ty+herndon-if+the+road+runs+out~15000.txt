   I won't stand in your way I understand When it calls your name you've gotta chase that restless wind I won't break down or let you see my tears Cause baby I know what you're looking for just ain't here But if the road runs out and those dreams run dry And that big old world gets to spinning too fast Don't think twice I'll be right here still loving you And don't you ever think that you can't turn around If the road runs out I can't say goodbye the words won't come I want to get on my knees and beg you please but I'm bitin my tongue I can wish you luck and I can say a prayer That your skies are blue when you spread your wings and fly out there If the road runs out and those dreams run dry And that big old world gets to spinning too fast Don't think twice I'll be right here still loving you Don't you ever think that you can't turn around If the road runs out If the road runs out baby Baby spread your wings If the road runs out and your those dreams run dry And that big old world gets to spinning too fast Don't think twice Cause I'll be right here still loving you Don't you ever think you can't turn around Don't you ever think you can't turn around If the road runs out If the road runs out baby You can come back home You've got to fly Baby spread your wings Baby spread your wings And  fly
