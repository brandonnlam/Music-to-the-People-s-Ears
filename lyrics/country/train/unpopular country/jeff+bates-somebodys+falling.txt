   Somebody's picking up flowers Got a real nice bottle of wine Somebody's counting down the hours Can't hardly wait till it's time Somebody somebody's falling Somebody's falling in love Two lucky lovers Finding each other Somebody's falling in love Somebody's taking a hot bath Making sure her makeup's just right She's about to slip on that hot dress yeah Making sure it happens tonight Somebody somebody's falling Somebody's falling in love The flames of the fire Getting hotter and higher Somebody's falling in love He feels like a man when she comes around She feels like a woman when he lays her down Somebody somebody's falling Somebody's falling in love Somebody somebody's falling Somebody's falling in love Anyone can see it Girl it ain't no secret Somebody's falling in love
