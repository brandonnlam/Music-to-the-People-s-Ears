   I think honesty is right think lying is wrong. I think Willy and Haggard wrote some awful good songs. I think God rides around with the radio on in a ragged ole truck just like mine. I don't think it's as bad as the newspaper says. I think Vegas is rigged But then I wouldn't bet on these theories and thoughts rollin' round in my head  Cuz they change and they turn on a dime. Chorus: But I know there's a sun and at night there's a moon. I get cold in December and sunburnt in June. This ole world keeps turnin' Time it ain't movin it's slow  There's a woman that loves me like nobody can. She's my reason for livin' the reason I am The luckiest man in the world. And that's all I know. I think taxes are high think politics stink. But old Unlce Sam don't give a damn what I think. And I don't believe worms aughta be in a drink  But I swallowed once on a dare. Think there's only one Beatles and Elvis is dead. And I don't believe half of the stuff we been feed  From the spoons in the hands of those ole talkin' heads I'm not even sure that I care. Chorus: But I know there's a sun and at night there's a moon. I get cold in December and sunburnt in June. This ole world keeps turnin' Time it ain't movin it's slow  There's a woman that loves me like nobody can. She's my reason for livin' the reason I am The luckiest man in the world. And that's all I know. I've got a family that loves me like nobody can. They're my reason for livin' the reason I am The luckiest man in the world I'm the luckiest man in the world  And that's all I know. That's all I know That's all I know
