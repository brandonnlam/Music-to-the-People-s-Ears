   David Ball/Kostas Where ever you go we go amigo Been there through thick and thin Down and out and back again Where ever you go we go amigo On the road that leads us to the setting sun Some people think you're just an old guitar That may be true but that's not all you are No matter where I go or what I do I can always find a friend in you Where ever you go we go amigo Been there through thick and thin Down and out and back again Where ever you go we go amigo On the road that leads us to the setting sun We got into a mess in Abilene She was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen The song you played made her forget that night That she was the sheriff's lonely wife Where ever you go we go amigo Been there through thick and thin Down and out and back again Where ever you go we go amigo On the road that leads us to the setting sun I think it's time to hit the road again And see what's waiting 'round the bend Saddle up old friend we're leaving this old town Drifting with the clouds bumming around Where ever you go we go amigo Been there through thick and thin Down and out and back again Where ever you go we go amigo On the road that leads us to the setting sun
