   If we can't get along We aught to be apart And I'm wondering where'd you Get that cold cold heart. Set me free. Sign my release. I'm tired of being a Villian of the peace. You've been giving me bad times Tell me what'd I do. How come I always get a hard time Honey when it comes to you. Saying things  that you didn't have to. How come I always get a hard time Honey when it comes to you. You only get one life And this I know. I want to get my licks In now before I go. Fire of love. Is dead and cold. I got to satisfy The hunger in my soul. You been giving me bad times. Tell me what'd I do. How come I always get a hard time Honey when it comes to you. Saying things that you didn't have to. If we can't get along. We aught to be a part And I'm wondering where'd you Get that cold cold heart. Set me free. Sign my release. I'm tired of being a Villian of the peace. You been giving me bad times. Tell me what'd I do. How come I always get a hard time Honey when it comes to you Saying things that you didn't have to. How come I always get a hard time Honey when it comes to you. How come I always get a hard time Honey when it comes to you.
