   Jesse James was an outlaw man He was always breakin' the law Six guns firing from both his hands Fastest you ever saw Did he do it for the money Or was it for the fame Finally somebody asked him Jesse why you wanna rob them trains And Jessie said It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin' It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin' I'm the meanest hombre you ever saw 'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all It's just what I do It's just what I do Well Orville Wright Set his sights High up in the air Him and Wilbur worked day and night He didn't seem to care Well the town folk said if you were meant to fly God would have given you wings What makes you want to spend all of your time Building that flying machine And Orville said It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin' It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin' I'm the first flight boy you ever saw 'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all It's just what I do It's just what I do Ooh yeah Well Picasso painted them pictures There was beauty in every stroke When asked about his motivation He said I think it's about time you should know It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin' It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin' I'm the workinest painter that you ever saw 'Cause lately I ain't gettin' no lovin' at all It's just what I do It's just what I do It's just what I do It's just what I do when I can't get no lovin'
