   There's no holding you back when you're leaving I'll have to face it alone until tomorrow And as your fading away I know it's a matter of hours til the tears begin Guess I'll turn out the lights and I'll settle in For the long one For the restless night As your memory fades with no end in sight It's a strong one and it holds on tight Laying in the darkness Praying for the morning sun It's a long one I've been through this before it wasn't easy I think I'm ready this time I think I'm ready I'll lay down on this bed and then I'll imagine your touch and I'll see your face And the shadows will come and surround this place For the long one For the restless night As your memory fades with no end in sight It's a strong one and it holds on tight Laying in the darkness Praying for the morning sun It's a long one These days go by so fast I just turn around then they're gone And when the night time goes It's long and lonely Holding on and on For the long one For the restless night As your memory fades with no end in sight It's a strong one and it holds on tight Laying in the dark Praying for the morning sun It's a long one It's a long one
