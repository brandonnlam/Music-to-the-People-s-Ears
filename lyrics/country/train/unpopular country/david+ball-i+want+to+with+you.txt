   Well I guess I've been traveling light my whole life through Thought if you never own nothing much nothing ever owns you Until I looked at you I swear I never gave one thought to forever Girl I never wanted to Find a little spread with a creek running through Build a little dream and make it come true But now I want to with you girl I want to with you Put I little ring third finger left hand Stay with somebody who will love and understand Girl I want to with you When a man ain't looking no telling what he may find Until I saw the light of your love I was walking round blind I kept running with my restless heart thinking that's just the way things are Girl it never crossed my mind I think it's time to find a little spread... Find a little spread...
