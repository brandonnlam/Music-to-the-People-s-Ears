   If you're lyin' in bed you can't sleep You try readin' books you try countin' sheep Ooo ooo me too If you're losin' your case burnin' your toast You're pourin' hot coffee on your Cheerios Ooo ooo me too Now don't worry baby it's all right You're just a little preoccupied Somethin's got ahold and it won't let loose I know exactly what you're goin' through Do you feel like you're fallin' in love Me too Now have you got a queasy feelin' deep inside It hurts just a little but it feels kinda nice Ooo ooo me too You say you sit for hours by the telephone You even jump in the shower with your underwear on Ooo ooo me too Now don't worry baby it's all right You're just a little preoccupied Somethin's got ahold and it won't let loose I know exactly what you're goin' through Do you feel like you're fallin' in love Me too Do you find yourself listenin' to the mushy love songs Are you likin' what they're sayin' are you singin' along Do you feel like you've fallen in love Do you feel like you've fallen in love Do you feel like you've fallen in love Me too oh me too Me too baby
