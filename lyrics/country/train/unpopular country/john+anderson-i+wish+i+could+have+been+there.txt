   When our baby Kate was born It was the biggest day of my life Lying there with bows in her hair In the loving arms of my wife I was the proudest papa in the usa Making a livin' on the road somewhere a thousand miles away It was a happy day but kinda sad I wish I could've been there I wish I could've been there I wish I could've been there for that Little Bobby hit his first homerun He was the hero of the hometown crowd 2 to 1 it was a winning run Everybody was cheering loud And mama she was smiling Saying hes a chip off off the old block But I was on the road somewhere Between Memphis and Little Rock It was a happy day but kinda sad I wish I could've been there I wish I could've been there I wish I could've been there for that Now Bobby and Kate are all grown up And moved away They stayed in touch We're proud of the two good kids we raised And its hard to believe we are celebrating our 25th year today "this party's nice but the kids arent here At least they called to say Congratulations mom and dad I wish we could've been there I wish we could've been there I wish we could've been there for that It was a happy day but kinda sad I wish they could've been there I wish they could've been there I wish they could've been there for that
