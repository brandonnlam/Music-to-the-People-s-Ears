   Hello yes I'm calling to arrange a little trip Somewhere far away from here by train or plane or ship I'd like to leave today it don't have to be first class No it's not for pleasure but I'll tell you since you asked I'm going someplace to forget someplace her memory won't show up So far everywhere I've been hasn't been quite far enough Is there a rocket to the moon I haven't been there yet I just need to leave real soon I'm going someplace to forget No there's not much luggage just this old suitcase of mine Things that make me think of her I've got to leave behind Yes I'll be returning when I don't know It all depends on how long it takes my heart to let her go I'm going someplace to forget... I just need to leave real soon I'm going someplace to forget
