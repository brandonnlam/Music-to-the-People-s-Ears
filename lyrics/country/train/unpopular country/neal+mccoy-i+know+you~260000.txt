   You walk into the room guys just turn and stare Thinking maybe you might go home with them Acting like they've got a prayer you act like they ain't there I know what's on their minds wondering who you're with Who's the lucky guy must be filthy rich That when you come over and kiss the smile that's on my lips Girl we got something they don't understand And I can love you like nobody can 'cause Chorus I know you your every thought your every dream And every mood what you want and what you need Love never felt so true I know you the way you walk the way you breathe Your every move has a way of touching me And brings me to my knees when it comes to what I need Baby you know me We don't have to say every little word To communicate matters of the heart Girl as far as I'm concerned we just love and learn Baby you and I we don't scream and shout Got the kind of love and affection that Others only dream about we always work it out There are no secrets between you and me I love you more and more the more I see 'cause Repeat chorus I know you your every thought your every dream And every mood what you want &amp what you need Love never felt so true I know you the way you walk the way you breathe Your every move has a way of touching me And brings me to my knees Oh baby you know me Bridge I know you your favorite song your favorite things I know you the way you love walking in the rain Baby you know it's true
