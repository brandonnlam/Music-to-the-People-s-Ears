   Chris Cagle/M. Jason Greene Hey hey turn up that song I think about you when it comes on And I get lifted off the ground And when you're in my arms I feel the beat down in my heart It makes my world spin around So come on baby you know the moment's right Yeah take me by the hand And we can rock away the night I wanna dance 'til the break of day To the music that we make There's never been a sweeter sound I wanna wake the neighbours Make the headlines in the morning paper No I don't wanna turn it down 'Cause there's nothing like the rhythm of love So play it loud You're like a melody And girl it gets all over me When you move the way you do And oooh when I feel your touch Then it gets to be too much You know it puts me in a mood Come on baby don't be shy Just open up your heart and hold on tight I wanna dance 'til the break of day To the music that we make There's never been a sweeter sound I wanna wake the neighbors Make the headlines in the morning paper No I m not gunna turn it down 'Cause there's nothing like the rhythm of love So play it loud So come on baby you know the moment's right Yeah take me by the hand And we can rock away the night I wanna dance 'til the break of day To the music that we make There's never been a sweeter sound I wanna wake the neighbors Make the headlines in the morning paper There ain't no way to turn it down 'Cause there's nothing the rhythm of love There's nothing like the rythm of love So play it loud
