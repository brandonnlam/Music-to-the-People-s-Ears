   Jerry Salley/Darryl Worley Today I drove through this ol' town Took a real good look around Saw a lot of things I'd never seen before An older couple holding hands Young lovers picking out wedding bands Things I'd never noticed Until my eyes met yours Now I'm seeing things I've never seen Dreaming dreams I've never dreamed There's been such a change in me Since I felt your touch Everywhere I go it seems folks Can't get close enough Is the whole world in love Or is it just us When you walk with your head down All you see's the cold hard ground But I looked up in time to catch a glimpse of you If everyone on God's green earth Knew true love and what it's worth They'd know how I'm feeling And share my point of view 'cause Now I'm seeing things I've never seen Dreaming dreams I've never dreamed There's been such a change in me Since I felt your touch Everywhere I go it seems folks Can't get close enough Is the whole world in love Or is it just us Everywhere I go it seems folks Can't get close enough Is the whole world in love Or is it just us Is it just us
