   For so long I searched in desperation For one love that would always be true And I came close but there were always complications I finally decided there was nothing I could do So I gave up and I let go And as soon as I did wouldn't you know Just look what I found when I wasn't lookin' Look what I found when I was just bein' me I turned around and love was mine for the takin' Look what I found when she found me Now there's a lot of lonely people out there waiting And there's a lot of lonely people searchin' to But if you've got too many expectations You might miss the one who's right in front of you No tellin' when no tellin' why She'll say hello and you'll know You'll never say goodbye Just look what I found when I wasn't lookin' Look what I found when I was just bein' me I turned around and love was mine for the takin' Look what I found when she found me And every single day I'm still surprised When I turn around and look into her eyes I'm like a kid who won a prize Look what I found Just look at what I found Look what I found when I wasn't lookin' Look what I found when I was just bein' me I turned around and love was mine for the takin' Look what I found when she found me
