   I'm blown away when I look at you While you look at me 'Cause you see me so completely I'm overwhelmed by the way it feels 'Cause I know it's real When you reach out to touch me You consume me you know I can't resist And you move me with the power of a little kiss It feels like a ton of love Followed by a mountain of Emotions coming over me To take complete control of me And I get swept away Deeper in it every day And Lord I swear that I'll never give you up 'Cause girl you hit my heart with a ton of love When we're apart your in my heart You're on my mind 'Cause our souls are connected And when the distance between us grows Everybody knows that we're not affected And when you're with me it's heaven right here on earth Girl you give me more than any one man could deserve It feels like a ton of love Followed by a mountain of Emotions coming over me To take complete control of me And I get swept away Deeper in it every day And Lord I swear that I'll never give you up 'Cause girl you hit my heart with a ton of love Girl I get swept away Deeper in it every day And Lord I swear that I'll never give you up 'Cause girl you hit my hear with a ton of love I'm blown away when I look at you You take complete control of me You consume me You move me When we're apart you're in my heart
