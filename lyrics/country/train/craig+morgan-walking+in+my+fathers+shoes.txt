   Craig Morgan/Jeff Knight He made it to every ball game Unless he just had to go to work He always said a man's got to juggle his time and his money And he's got to know what each one is worth He taught me so many things Even when he wasn't trying to And when I'm in a situation I can't figure out I just ask myself what would he do I'm walking in my father's shoes He's never let me down That's a lot to live up to Stumbling falling Tryin' to stand tall in Walking in my father's shoes I'm balancing my checkbook balancing my life Chasing down a dollar trying to buy some time I jump out in the fast lane sometimes I risk it all Running myself right down to a crawl Then I get up on Sunday morning And get down on my knees I always feel that he's right there listening Giving me direction and giving me strength I'm walking in my father's shoes He's never let me down That's a lot to live up to Stumbling falling Tryin' to stand tall in Walking in my father's shoes Yes I'm stumbling and falling Trying to stand tall in Walking in my father's shoes
