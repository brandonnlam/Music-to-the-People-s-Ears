   I get up like a rocket in a hurricane Then it's off to work like a runaway train Drivin' them nails draggin' my tail It don't take much to follow my trail follow my trail Back and forth in a game of pickle I ain't nothing but the monkey in the middle Walking that sideshow tight rope making ends meet That organ grinder be in a bind without me In that circus they work us like a bunch of borrowed mules But everytime that music plays I know what to do Every Friday night at the honky tonk Me and my baby make that dive jump When our buckles bump I tell you what That girl is packing some powerful stuff powerful stuff And when we get home she plays me like a fiddle Makin' sweet music with the monkey in the middle Walking that sideshow tightrope makin' ends meet That organ grinder be in a bind without me In that circus they work us like a bunch of borrowed mules But everytime that music plays sugar I know what to do And then. I get up like a rocket in a hurricane Then it's off to work like a runaway train Drivin' them nails draggin' my tail It don't take much to follow my trail follow my trail Back and forth in a game of pickle I ain't nothing but the monkey in the middle
