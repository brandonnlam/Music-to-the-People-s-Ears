   Hung over and hard up Broken down and messed up I never saw your leaving comin' but  I sure felt it when ya left Memory button stuck on repeat Mind skippin' like a record machine Over and over that goodbye scene Keeps spinnin' in my head It keeps haunting me And there ain't no maybe about it The hurt keeps calling me  Come on out we got you surrounded Yeah the bottle in my hand is loaded and I ain't afraid to use it tonight Hung over and hard up Pain hurts whiskey's tough And too much ain't ever enough To break through your space Livin' in a lost and found Round and round up and down I'm tired of this seesaw merry-go-round  So merry you can go to hell All I wanna do Is just get on down the highway And I'll be there as soon as I get on out of my way Yeah the truth is like a hangman's noose And it's holdin' up my heart tonight Hung over and hard up I tried it all well now what I've given everything but up And up's going down the drain Just when I thought the coast was clear You're cloudin' up my atmosphere That mornin' sun's waitin' there when I wake up Hung over and hard up
