   Joe Nichols/Wil Nance/Steve Dean Hit the snooze when the 'larm clock rings Layin' there doin' that sleepy head thing There's a bird out my window spreadin' his wings Cheap chirp doin' that sing in' Thing I do when I first get up is the coffee thing in my favorite cup Or two gets me goin' got things to do Let me tell you a thing or two Ev'rything's a thing if you know what I mean You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing Some things are big some things are small Some mean a lot some nothin' at all It's all laid out in the scheme of things No matter what it is Ev'rything's a thing Off to work in my old Mustang Doin' that bumper to bumper thing Up ahead a-ring-a-ling-ding-ding Some guy's doin' that cell phone Thing is the light turns green and he ain't doin' that drivin' thing And the thing is about all this that talkin' thing and drivin' don't mix Ev'rything's a thing if you know what I mean You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing Some things are big some things are small Some mean a lot some nothin' at all It's all laid out in the scheme of things No matter what it is Ev'rything's a thing If you think this song ain't worth hummin' You got another thing... Comin' Ev'rything's a thing if you know what I mean You can't do nothin' 'cause there's no such thing Some things are big some things are small Some mean a lot some nothin' at all It's all laid out in the scheme of things No matter what it is Ev'rything's a thing Ev'rything's a thing Ev'rything's a thing
