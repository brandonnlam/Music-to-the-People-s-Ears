   Well hey girl what's ur name Haven't I seen you before I recognized them dark green eyes when you dosey doed across the floor Are you alone or are you with someone She said a matter of fact I'm not So I took her hand that's when it all began and we headed towards the parking lot Chorus: And she said hey boy do you mind takin me home tonite ''cause I aint never seen a country boy with tires on his truck this High I said climb on up but watch the cup that I spit my dip inside and hold on tight 'cause it's gonna be wilder than any 8 second ride We went riding round rocking to the sound of Country Boy Can Surivive And I knew then that she was my kind of girl 'cause she was singing every single line Then she slid on over put my hand on her Shoulder and I aksed her what she wanted to do She said it don't matter where we go just as long as I'm riding with you Chorus: And she said hey boy do you mind takin me home tonite ''cause I aint never seen a country boy with tires on his truck this high I said climb on up but watch the cup that I spit my dip inside And hold on tight 'cause it's gonna be wilder than any 8 second ride So we headed out to old tobacco road Put the tailgate down and we made love She said true country boys hard to find but I found one wilder than any 8 second ride Chorus: And she said hey boy do you mind takin me home tonite ''cause I aint never seen a country boy with tires on his truck this High I said climb on up but watch the cup that I spit my dip inside And hold on tight 'cause it's gonna be wilder than any 8 second ride Yea hold on tight 'cause it's gonna be wilder than any 8 second ride
