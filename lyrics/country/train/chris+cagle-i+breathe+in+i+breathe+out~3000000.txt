   Lately I've been runnin' Into our old friends And somewhere in the small talk Someone always asks where you've been So I tell them what you told me And they can't believe we're through They ask me what I'm doin' now And in case you're wonderin' too I breathe in I breathe out Put one foot in front of the other Take one day at a time 'Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without Until then I breathe in and breathe out I've got every reason To find someone new Cause you swore up and down to me That I've seen the last of you But the way that you loved me Girl left me hopin' and holdin' on So until this world stops turning round And my heart believes you're gone I breathe in I breathe out Put one foot in front of the other Take one day at a time 'Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without Until then I breathe in and breathe out We were meant to be Girl there's no doubt And if it takes the rest of my life For you to figure it out
