   I have never had an easy life But I'm not complaining It has taught me how to stand and fight For what I believe in I guess that's just how I was raised I find it hard to walk away I will not back down When you push me to the wall Expecting me to fall I will not give in I am not afraid to fight For what I know is right I can only take so much And when I've had enough It's not in my blood to just lay down I will hold my ground I try my best to get through every day Without confrontation Stayin' out of everybody's way But then on occasion Somebody steps across the line And it's not too long before they find I will not back down When you push me to the wall Expecting me to fall I will not give in I am not afraid to fight For what I know is right I can only take so much And when I've had enough It's not in my blood to just lay down I will hold my ground I will not back down When you push me to the wall Expecting me to fall I will not give in I am not afraid to fight For what I know is right I can only take so much And when I've had enough It's not in my blood to just lay down I will hold my ground No it's not in my blood to just lay down I will hold my ground Yeah I will hold my ground I will hold my ground I will hold my ground I will hold my ground
