   I saw it in her eyes when I was sayin' goodbye That girl she ain't gonna be alright 'Cause I could tell that she'd be goin' through a livin' hell And I I wouldn't be there by her side And lord I felt so bad as I sat and watched her cry Thinkin' I was movin' on and she was barely gettin' by Look at what I've done to her Look at how I made her feel I gave back her heart the broken part She got the raw end of the deal And look at what it's done to me You gotta know it tears me up I gave it everything I had and lord It just wasn't enough Hurtin' her like this seems so wrong Yeah look at what I've done to her Now she's alone I saw her out last night and she was havin' a good time That girl it looks like she's doin' fine But then I saw a man walk up and take her by the hand And I oh God I almost died And then it hit me she didn't really need me I just sat there for a while until I finally smiled Yeah look at what I've done to her Look at how I made her feel She's found somebody new And look who took the time to heal And look at what it's done to me Gotta know it tears me up To have walked away from the love we made And just leave it in a cloud of dust And now it's got me thinkin' maybe I was wrong After all the things I've done to her Now she's strong And I walked up and said hello She said it's good to see ya But hey I gotta go And look at what I've done to her Look how I made her feel She's standin' tall she's got it all Got the world at her heels And look at what it's done to me Yeah look at how it makes me hurt If I could go back now I swear somehow I'd find a way to make it work Ain't life funny now I'm the one alone Yeah look at what I've done to me She's gone
