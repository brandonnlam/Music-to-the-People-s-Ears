   Darryl Worley/Steve Leslie There's an old friendly breeze that blows in the Gulf of Mexico Somehow it always knows when I'm feeling low So I'm gonna anchor down and wait till it comes around Leave the rest of the world behind yeah that's how I'll pass the time Till I catch my second wind get back up and gain control again Find the strength I lost back when you stopped loving me I guess I'll just stay out here until I know the coast is clear Sit and watch the tide roll in till I catch my second wind There's a peace in the way I feel when the water's still And as long as it's calm out here I've got time to kill But as soon as it starts to stir I'll lose track of the way things were Float away on the open air but I'm not going anywhere Till I catch my second wind get back up and gain control again Find the strength I lost back when you stopped loving me I guess I'll just stay out here until I know the coast is clear Sit and watch the tide roll in till I catch my second wind
