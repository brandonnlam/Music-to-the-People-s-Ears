   Long truck bed hop in it fire engine red like a lipstick Out here we can let it go yeah Just me and my good friends jug of wine lil' sip Out here baby you just never know Yeah these are the days of gold Well its a southern summer Whiskey's in the air dog's on the burner Beer's ice cold got a pretty little lady to hold Southern summer At that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar Gotta hop on that old dirt road to the days of gold The July sky so high moon shining by the river side Stealing hearts and running wild In our own little world Tennessee boys and girls running free Out here it's good times for miles Yeah these are the days of gold Well it's a Southern summer Whiskey's in the air dog's on the burner Beer's ice cold got a pretty little lady to hold Southern summer And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold A little bit of you a little bit of me What you wanna do what's it gonna be We can get a wild we can live free Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine Slice the watermelon and you spit the seed Sweat on your back's stickin' to the seat We can sneak off to beat the heat I'll be buzzing on you honey like a bumble bee Yeah it's a Southern summer Whiskey's in the air dog's on the burner Beer's ice cold got a pretty little lady to hold Southern summer And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold
