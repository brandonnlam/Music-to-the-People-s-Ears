   This old boat kept us afloat All those years on the lake I remember that day I heard my best friend say This is probably the last trip I'll make Cause the doctors are sayin' It ain't lookin' good And they doubt that I'll make it to spring And it's a hell of a note When you never know What tomorrow might bring So I don't buy green bananas I don't play the lottery Right nows all I've got goin' Yeah And that's just fine for me And I don't own an umbrella If it rains I'm gonna get wet So I don't buy green bananas Cause' I don't plan that far ahead It ain't the same on these hot summer days When I'm out here fishin' alone Well sometimes I might get a few bites But then there's days that I don't So I just roll with the flow That I rock with the waves Catch me some rays from the sun Yeah and like my friends said I'm gonna live while I can And take each day as it comes So I don't buy green bananas I don't play the lottery Right nows all I've got goin' And that's just fine for me And I don't own an umbrella If it rains I'm gonna get wet And I don't buy green bananas Cause' I don't plan that far ahead I don't own an umbrella If it rains I'm gonna get wet And I don't buy green bananas Cause' I don't plan that far ahead
