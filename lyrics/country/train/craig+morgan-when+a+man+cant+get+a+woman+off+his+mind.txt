   I've been fightin' with these sheets again Can't make myself lie still My pillowcase is soakin' wet And yet I feel a chill It takes all I can do these days To just survive the nights It gets crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind When a man can't shake a memory He runs hot and cold and blind He hates her then he loves her Then he hates her one more time Your love has such a grip on me It chokes me like a vine Oh it's crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind I've been phonin' you since eight o'clock It's almost four a.m. My mind keeps paintin' pictures Of you out lovin' him I just crushed a dixie cup For runnin' out of wine It gets crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind When a man can't shake a memory He runs hot and cold and blind He hates her then he loves her Then he hates her one more time Your love has such a grip on me It chokes me like a vine Oh it's crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind
