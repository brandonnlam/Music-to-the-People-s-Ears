   You can see it from the river To the top of white pine ridge Burning like a summer sun A bunch of rednecks getting half lit There's mud-covered trucks and suvs Cranking out hank and ac/dc Chorus At the bonfire out in the sticks Country backwoods homegrown hicks Bonfire dance a little jig Hold up your cup and take another swig Won't sleep til dawn party right down to the wire At the bonfire Everybody sees the headlights When old Sheriff John pulled up We all got a little nervous It's too late to hide our cups He pops a top and hollers real loud Don't worry yall I came to hang out (Repeat chorus You don't have to be from around here To know right where to go All you gotta do is load up And head towards glow (Repeat chorus At the bonfire Were all hanging at the bonfire
