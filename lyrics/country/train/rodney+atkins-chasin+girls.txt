   It started out summer fun chasin' Allie Brook with a water gun She'd laugh and she'd scream She'd run and say You can't catch me Well time passed I turned sixteen Cruisin' from the Sonic to the Dairy Queen yeah Runnin' the roads we ruled like kings We'd say hey here comes Allie with her hot friends Oh they got water balloons in their hands Oh man they got me now let's get them Chasin' girls what a life Man I love them can't get enough of them From their toes up to their curls Chasin' girls hard to catch sweet to hold Even tougher to let them go Ain't nothin' like it in the whole wide world Chasin' girls Caught Allie Brook and that was that Bought a bungalow on a culdasac yeah Settled in and I knew my girl chasin' days were through Until she handed me an ept I said tell me what this blue strip means And that was then and now our twins are three And it's who left the Popsicle on the couch Don't let that dog lick it in the mouth Up and down all around this house I'm right back to where I started out Chasin' girls what a life Man I love them can't get enough of them From their toes up to their curls Chasin' girls hard to catch sweet to hold Even tougher to let them go Ain't nothin' like it in the whole wide world Chasin' girls Last night I had a nightmare the future was now here My little girls were in their teens And then these teenage boys appeared oh no yeah Chasing girl' hard to catch sweet to hold Even tougher to let them go Ain't nothin' like it in the whole wide world Chasin' girls chasin' girls
