   Jim Moose Brown/Dave Turnball/Dan Demay Buddy you and me go way back Camp Leguene all through high school and before that So I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death The doctor's going in on the 25th It's the same thing my daddy had Thank God they caught it fast Chorus 1: But if something should happen Stop in some time and say hello to Catherine You and Mary Ann could always keep her laughing She's gonna need a lot of that Take her out to a movie It's gonna take some time before she's back on her feet I know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy But there's always that chance That's why I'm asking If Something Should Happen Little Nathan's growing up so fast This November he'll turn 10 he wants to play quarterback I'm supposed to coach his team this fall But I may not get to after all He's gonna need someone to catch a pass And to throw it back Chorus 2: If something should happen Promise me you'll take that boy out camping Throw a line out in the water every now and then Answer any questions that he has Maybe once he gets older You could sit and have that first cold beer together Tell him a couple stories on his father He's always known you're my best friend That's why I'm asking If Something Shcould Happen Bridge: I hope I live until I'm 80 And I get to see my son get married and have babies and make a million more memories with my wife Yeah buddy I pray you're right But if it's my time to leave could you watch over them for me If Something Should Happen If Something Should Happen
