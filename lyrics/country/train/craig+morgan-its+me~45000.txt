   Craig Morgan/Steve Dean/Wil Nance If you hear a voice a-whistlin' Outside your window baby It ain't a robin or a bluebird it's me If the postman brings a package With big hearts on the wrapper And you wonder who it came from it's me Who loves you baby Please don't think I'm crazy If I go to the extreme There ain't nothin' I won't do To hear you say you love me too Say it's me If you see a plane fly over Pullin' a big banner And the letters spell I love you it's me If you hear a DJ Send a love song out to your name From a guy who's wild about you it's me Who loves you baby Please don't think I'm crazy If I go to the extreme There ain't nothin' I won't do To hear you say you love me too Say it's me Who loves you baby Please don't think I'm crazy If I go to the extreme There ain't nothin' I won't do To hear you say you love me too Say it's me
