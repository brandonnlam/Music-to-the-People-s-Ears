Drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight Got a Tennessee girl a Rocky Top breeze And a big ol' yellow moon A new set of strings on my '69 And a Yeti full of iced-down booze Everybody 'round this sleepy little town Heading down Pinetucky Road Gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust Right there by the old fence post Yeah we're gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights Life can be an ol' briar patch Gotta dance your way through it sometimes So we're gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight Got a pig in the ground stars in the sky And a jar full of lightning juice Got a worn-out path to the river bank Everybody coming out of them boots Gonna pick a few songs all night long Ones that we grew up on Some fishing in the dark some Copperhead Road Everybody just sing along Gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights Life can be an ol' briar patch Gotta dance your way through it sometimes So we're gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight Yeah we're gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights Life can be an ol' briar patch Gotta dance your way through it sometimes So we're gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight Yeah we're gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights Life can be an ol' briar patch Gotta dance your way through it sometimes So we're gonna drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight Drink a little beer play a little music And have a big time tonight That's right Ah come on boys whoo This is so weird having my dad on a song right now Considering he's 50 Uh 47 I think he's gonna make a comeback album and this is the start of it I taught you everything you know son But not everything I know We through playing now
