If I could have a beer with Jesus Heaven knows I’d sip it nice and slow I’d try to pick a place that ain’t too crowded Or gladly go wherever he wants to go You can bet I’d order up a couple tall ones Tell the waitress put ‘em on my tab I’d be sure to let him do the talkin’ Careful when I got the chance to ask How’d you turn the other cheek To save a sorry soul like me Do you hear the prayers I send What happens when life ends And when you think you’re comin’ back again I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it If I could have a beer with Jesus If I could have a beer with Jesus I’d put my whole paycheck in that jukebox Fill it up with nothing but the good stuff Sit somewhere we couldn’t see a clock Ask him how’d you turn the other cheek To save a sorry soul like me Have you been there from the start How’d you change a sinner’s heart And is heaven really just beyond the stars I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it If I could have a beer with Jesus He can probably only stay for just a couple rounds But I hope and pray he’s stayin’ till we shut the whole place down Ask him how’d you turn the other cheek To save a sorry soul like me What’s on the other side Is mom and daddy alright And if it ain’t no trouble tell them I said hi I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it If I could have a beer with Jesus I’d tell everyone but no one would believe it If I could have a beer with Jesus
