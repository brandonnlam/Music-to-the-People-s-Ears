Baby last night was hands down One of the best nights That I've had no doubt Between the bottle of wine And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain And I know that I can't ever tell you enough That all I need in this life is your crazy love If I never get to see the Northern lights Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand Baby I could die a happy man A happy man baby Humming Baby and that red dress brings me to my knees Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe You're a saint you're a goddess the cutest the hottest a masterpiece It's too good to be true nothing better than you In my wildest dreams And I know that I can't ever tell you enough That all I need in this life is your crazy love If I never get to see the Northern lights Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand Baby I could die a happy man yeah yeah Humming I don't need no vacation no fancy destination Baby you're my great escape We could stay at home listen to the radio Or dance around the fireplace And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia Or drive a sports car up the coast of California Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand Baby I could die a happy man Baby I could die a happy man Oh I could die a happy man You know I could girl I could die I could die a happy man Humming
