    "- What version of Python should I use? 3.6!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of these questions require writing Python code and computing results, and the rest of them have textual answers. To generate the answers, you will have to fill out a supporting file, `hw1.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For all of the textual answers you have to fill out have placeholder text which says \"Answer in one or two sentences here.\" For each question, you need to replace \"Answer in one or two sentences here\" with your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write all the answers in this ipython notebook. Once you are finished (1) Generate a PDF via (File -> Download As -> PDF) and upload to Gradescope (2)Turn in `hw_1.py` and `hw_1.ipynb` on Moodle.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Important** check your PDF before you turn it in to gradescope to make sure it exported correctly. If ipython notebook gets confused about your syntax it will sometimes terminate the PDF creation routine early. If your whole PDF does not print, try running `$jupyter nbconvert --to pdf 2018hw1.ipynb` to identify and fix any syntax errors that might be causing problems\n",
    "\n",
    "- When creating your final version of the PDF to hand in, please do a fresh restart and execute every cell in order. Then you'll be sure it's actually right. One handy way to do this is by clicking `Cell -> Run All` in the notebook menu.\n",
    " \n",
    "- This assignment is designed so that you can run all cells in a few minutes of computation time. If it is taking longer than that, you probably have made a mistake in your code."

    "In this section, you will verify a key statistical properties of text: [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipf's Law describes the relations between the frequency rank of words and frequency value of words.  For a word $w$, its frequency is inversely proportional to its rank:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$count_w = K \\frac{1}{rank_w}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "for some constant $K$, specific to the corpus and how words are being defined.\n",

    "\n",
    "Please make such a log-log plot by ploting the rank versus frequency **Hint: Make use of the sorted dictionary you just created.**.  Use a scatter plot where the x-axis is the *log(rank)*, and y-axis is *log(frequency)*.  You should get this information from `word_counts`; for example, you can take the individual word counts and sort them.  dict methods `.items()` and/or `values()` may be useful.  (Note that it doesn't really matter whether ranks start at 1 or 0 in terms of how the plot comes out.) You can check your results by comparing your plots to ones on Wikipedia; they should look qualitatively similar.\n",

Also review the NaiveBayes class variables in the `def __init__` method of the NaiveBayes class  to get a sense of which statistics are important to keep track of. Once you have implemented `update_model`, run the train model function using the code below. What is the size of the vocabulary used in the training documents?
